The government should promote productive investment, enhance the knowledge of the economy and protect the environment from harm. Let's rebuild together. Let's stand together.
","Finally, the link below wouldn't even open.  Also, it is very tiring to read misinformation, time and time again.  I found that part of this very tedious.  As a former CFO I often help company's and MBA schools work with companies for the Wall Street presentations.  Recently I had to let a school know that the company's presentation was basically ""blowing smoke up the investor's ass"".  Also, I advised them that their stats were very good considering all that is going on, so don't paint a false picture just present the facts the best way possible.  Covid is similar.  Making it political has altered the facts.  Example:  Saying someone died of Covid when actually they would have died anyway.  False positives figured into the stream of information.  The lists go on.  Having to read posts I would not waste my time on has been actually a negative for me.  

Have you ever even heard of Senegal? Tell me one reason why we shouldn't be doing better at responding to Covid than they are. Go on. I'm waiting.

I have actually cut my FB time down because as each decade goes by, stupidity drives me more nuts then ever.  I am shocked at how many people will post or share something that is totally misleading or just out and out Fake News.

What has happened to people who actually followed politics, the environment, etc. and could discuss and debate stands from both sides?  Another example from the current times:  BLM.  Really?  The civil war and slavery was ended a long time ago.  I was a 50% owner of a good size specialized construction company.  We built federal facilities, hospitals, schools, huge tilt-wall building etc.  90% or higher of our employees were LEGAL immigrants and minorities.  In all our years none of the blacks wanted to move ahead.  We had a clear pathway to advancement.  I would ask them and they all replied that they were making great money and quite happy.  They lived in the same neighborhoods they grew up in.  These neighborhoods were not good...but they didn't move out even though they could afford to.  The Hispanics were basically over-achievers.  They worked hard to become legal citizens and many strived to get employed by our company.  They knew that their English had to be perfect because they would be dealing with people who only spoke English.  They came to America for a better life for them and their families and their children were raised with the over-achiever attitude that the parents had.  All our years I could never understand why the blacks didn't care about achieving more.  They were happy with status quo.  This is something that is instilled in you at home.  Maybe, just maybe, studies should be done as to why their is a nice percentage of Blacks who do create great lives for them and their families....but a larger percentage that just waits for handouts or status quo.  Why?  Who has done this to them?  Was it a particular political party that wanted to keep them ""down""?  Was it a lack of inspiration from the adults in their life?  Was it a ""fatherless"" home?  I am not try to be flippant, I am truly wondering why since I had people in my life that were like this.  ",3,5,"Thank you for letting me take part.  I am not sure what exactly you were trying to prove, but if I may make a suggestion:  Give people topics to talk about, but allow them free reign to discuss on an open forum.  Originally get their ideas on topics, then after a week of free forums what are their views.  Encourage strong opinions that they back up with the why factor as to the reasons the feel that way.  For instance, I had the opportunity to live in Europe for 5 years.  I know what living with socialized medicine and thankfully my husbands company told me to go private and they footed the bill after my first ""disaster"" in Sweden.  My stories may not change how people feel, but it would hopefully make them realize that what they think is ideal may have a few quirks.  Good luck with future studies and this current one.  ",39231

However, my huge sympathy goes to the people who rather die in their own homes then got burn with huge hospital debt. ","I had stated in the first dartpost survey that I am pro-GMOs. However, after reading some of the GMOs-related posts for a few days, it makes sense why a lot of people are quite skeptical about it. Some of the arguments said that since GMOs are just like 20 years in the market, the long term effect due to the consumption of GMOs is yet to be seen. Yes, it can be terrifying but I believe the scientist are working on it.   ",2,1,1,4,3,2,4,3,2,"I think some posts are intended to be controversial which for me is quite unrealistic.

""It's amazing all the other countries have the sense to blame China for the virus except Democrats in the US.They are such an embarrassment""

This post makes an impression on me as it refers to everyone accusing China, which I am not sure is true. In addition to this, he attacks the Democrats in a very offensive way, saying that they are a shame for the United States since they do not think the same as others. A strong and direct but malicious post","This one was good ..""White people that support black lives matters just don't want to be called racist.
Black people that support black lives matters just want to be victims""

This made me think that the support that people sometimes give to some movements really is not the most sincere, but that there is an interest involved. Not wanting to be involved or made fun of for not being part of the movement is one of the most common reasons. But I think that this is closely related to having a strong self-esteem. Very good post and it has a lot to reflect on about it, not only in this movement, but in everyone we know.
","I liked this as well...""Trump didn't want people to panic because of Coronavirus. He wants White people in the suburbs to panic because of Black people and Hispanics.""

It is a post that attacks the current president of the United States, and that reveals what the president shows in his day to days. That is, it shows more interest and concern in black people and Hispanics, more than in impact problems such as the coronavirus or the health system. This post is very good, although some people might think that it is offensive, rather than offensive it is real. A reality that everyone knows but few comment on, so I think this is a very good post.",2,2,2,2,3,2,4,3,2,"I think it is realistic depending on what you speak.
