These statistics, regarding nuclear power in the United States, did not surprise me, but they disappointed me. The sad fact is, the United States no longer has the technical prowess to build next-generation nuclear power plants of our own.  The United States' nuclear power capacity is at risk, too, because our nuclear power plants are slowly becoming more and more decrepit. Most of our nuclear power facilities are on governmental waivers allowing them to remain in operation, despite the fact that most of them should have begun decommissioning decades ago. Like most of the infrastructure in the United States today, our nuclear power plants are not being maintained to the highest standards. More efficient, and safer, nuclear power technology has been developed in other countries, such as Russia, who recognizes that nuclear is the wave of the future as far as energy is concerned for all practical purposes. The United States is woefully behind.","Another post that got a visceral reaction out of me was put up by Amy_731 that hysterically—if simply—declared: ""We have to be more vigilant! Terrorists may be planning attacks as we speak."" If there was ever a better demonstration of perfectly-repeated propaganda, I haven't seen it. It's true that the chance of a terrorist attack on U.S. soil is not zero. However, those that inhabit the United States have a much higher probability of being shot, while unarmed, by a police officer than being injured or killed in a foreign terrorist attack. Actually, now that I think about it, a police officer, to some, could be considered a terrorist, quite frankly. That's what most citizens of other countries feel that the United States is: the biggest threat to World Peace. The United States is THE ""mother of all terrorists,"" in other words. Literally and figuratively.","Molly_9336 posted similar propaganda regarding the United States' need to ""protect itself from terrorists"" with this post: ""With all we have on our plate now I don't want government to keep their eye off the ball of terrorists attack again on our soil. We all need to stand behind Homeland Security so that they and our military can keep us safe going into the future decades."" We exist, here in the United States, in a constant state of fear. Again, I realize that we do not have a zero chance of a terrorist attack occurring again on our soil. However, the risks posed by so many other threats are much higher. But, if we have any reason to feel anxious about a possible terrorist attack in the near future, it's because the United States has fomented so much rage, and bad faith, across the globe that it's amazing we HAVEN'T been on the receiving end of more terrorist attacks. With our military interventions, indiscriminate killing of civilian foreign nationals in theaters of conflict, CIA-orchestrated coup d'etats of authentic, democratically-elected foreign governments, and provacative meddling in the politics and affairs of other countries under false pretenses, it's a testament to the restraint of would-be terrorists that more terrorist attacks haven't taken place in the United States.

This upset me because the recovery all depends on who gets elected.  If Biden wins we will all be heading down the tube.  If Trump wins, he will get the economy roaring and the future will be bright.  It is a true shame so many people are ignorant on how the economy and economics work; how world affairs work; and the are of negotiation.  Blindness to these things is dangerous.
