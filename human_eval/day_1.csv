I disagree strongly.

Honestly I don't think people in that income level will miss 2%. It's mindboggling amounts of money to the rest of us, but would you miss 2% of YOUR income? My Mom used to work at a nursing home in the 80s and she would get a 2% annual raise, which honestly was more of an insult than anything. We could fund much needed childcare and infrastructure using that money. That's not even as high a tax rate as we've had in the past for the ultra rich.
