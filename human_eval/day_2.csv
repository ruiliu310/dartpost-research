","The news of Chadwick Boseman dying of colon cancer was shocking to me and made me sad. He was in his mid 40s and I had no idea. He was an acting fiend and was good at his work and he seemed healthy. It can be positive in the fact that it made awareness of the struggle people face but live life to the fullest and also that especially men need to get yearly cancer screenings.
","Hearing about Dwayne Johnson and his family testing positive for COVID was shocking to me and I felt sad. But he said he's on the other side of it and his family is doing well but was a struggle in the beginning and to fight if you have it. It's one of the hardest things he had to live through.

I'm really looking forward to spending some time in nature this Labor Day weekend. It worries me to think that future generations might not be able to enjoy the things that we do. If we don't make protecting the environment a priority, so much will be lost. There are ways to maintain economic growth that don't require us to abuse our planet's natural resources.","Jacob_1907

Since Covid and reopening of schools is on my mind right now, I think the post about how Florida is not releasing any information about how their school reopening is going caught my attention.   It may not be the most dramatic post on dart post, but it makes me wonder why Florida is hiding this info.  It makes me worry about how things will go here next week so a very negative post, in my opinion.",The next post that caught my attention was Jacob1907's poll asking if we thought there would be another terrorist attack in the next five years.  As I said my thoughts have been on Covid and a terrorist attack hadn't even entered my mind in recent months.... well now it did and it's a negative effect.,"Luke3460 Wealth Tax post.  Again, our local economy has suffered greatly and many regular people are suffering.  This caught my attention as both a positive and negative post.   People with more than 50 billion absolutely can afford to pay more to help keep our community services, schools, hospitals, first responders, etc. going.  ",1,2,4,1,1,1,1,3
