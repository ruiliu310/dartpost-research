The news headlines that shared by the user talked about how Trump mishandled the pandemic crisis that costs hundred thousand of deaths, millions of cases, many people lose their jobs, and so on. Honestly, I don't think Trump is a really bad president. Compared to Biden, he is much better as our president. But he is indeed failed in managing COVID-19 and his reputation is badly tarnish due to this. 
","Well, still about COVID-19. I saw a graph of the number of cases getting lower and the user said something like this ""It is interesting to see as the election getting closer, the total of cases is getting lower"". I do not agree about what he said. I think as time progress, our healthcare systems now are able to cope with all the cases. Shelter-in-place order in some states also helped to slow down the spread.

You can look at the thousands dead, millions who've lost jobs and/or been evicted, and some people will still say our government had no way of knowing what was coming and did a reasonably good job - the best they could. I beg to differ. Look at other nations around the world. The virus is nasty. No one is disputing that. But we have failed. Look at their responses compared to our government response. Look at the results.

Take a good, hard look. Facts, people.

This upset me.  The Feds, as a whole, have done a great job.  The states, not so much.  When I look at the liberal states and the issues in them, it has made my choices for November quite clear.  They have to be stopped.

GMOs have helped the US and Canada increase crop yields from 6 to 24 percent. Science Alert

This made me just think ""well duh"".  Why do you think GMO's are so popular?  Bottom line.

With Trump as the President of the United State, it's unlikely the United States experience a terrorist attack in the next ten years that will kill more than 1000 American civilians. With all the security measures put in place, I believe the USA is a safe country that's unlikely to be a target of attack from Terrorist group.
#trump#terrorism#attack#protection#usa

This pleased me.  You never read anything positive about Trump and to actually see something written as if it were on FB that is positive was REFRESHING.  I can't believe the brainwashing that has taken place the last 3+ years.  I actually do research, what a novel idea, and history will prove how Hitler like the media has become. It is a disgrace and the moderates are being squashed by the liberal lunatics.  Poor JFK, he must be rolling over in his grave.  If you are interested be sure to look up the historical scholar that wrote a wonderful piece about how JFK would have been a Republican (yes, Republican Today).",1,2,4,3,4,2,2,2
