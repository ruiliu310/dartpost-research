"Nuclear energy, with proper safety in place, is one the cleanest and most efficient forms of energy there is. ",
"but it creates nuclear waste,has major accidents,causing a risk of cancer,and the cost of nuclear energy is higher than others in comparrison.",
"I do not think the government has went to far.They are simply asking people to wear a mask, out of respect of others.",
while I can see that as being a global citizen I think its best we keep out since we have our own problems,
it can happen again and can be deadlier due to technology,
"What about school closings, closed restaurants and other businesses? The economy is suffering, open the country!",
I completely agree! It's not right!,
"He won't, its up to us to take care of ourselves.",
"Global problems are our problems: trade, world poverty, famine, immigration...",
I think the government waited too long to do anything. Lockdown and restricting groups should have happened almost immediately. SARS was a warning no one heeded along with the MERS virus. ,
"Security may be tighter, but we still get attacks, just on a smaller scale.",
"Couldn't agree more. Nature heals, but economic slowdowns and recessions inflict pain and suffering. ",
Its good to have our input on such matters. We can learn from others and they can learn from us.,
California is leading the way: https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2020/08/17/california-proposes-168-income-tax-rate-plus-4-wealth-tax/,
"Not sure we are fully secure here. Technology constantly changes and with that change come new exploits not caught. Those exploits will make us vulnerable. Homeland security is relatively a new entity created out of 911, although not a fail proof entity.",
"I feel like we are moving away from nuclear energy, but at much too slow a pace.",
"But nothing like 911, certainly not over 1000 deaths.",
Agreed!,
Campaign reelection promise: no more Covid! Vaccine by Nov 3.,
Nature will only heal if we leave it alone to do it's thing... If we keep destroying it and building on it it's not going to get a chance to heal. Economic growth needs to be able to work without destroying the planet.,
"My net worth is so far removed from 50 million, the issue seems almost farcical. As if it's a beyond-first-world-problems. And would be a comment only the one per-center's get.",
"Open the country to keep the Dow alive. 30,000 by Nov 3",
"It makes sense, nature will still be around once we're gone, but we need to get by as well, and for that we need an economy.",
You are violating the rights of others by not wearing a mask.,
"""Keep your friend's close, and your enemies closer."" Knowing what the other side of the globe is doing is important. The U.S. doesn't want any nasty surprises.",
"The government didn't act quick enough....If there had been a quicker response we wouldn't be looking at a death toll of over 180000
",
I agree,
"Oil is dead, solar/wind is inefficient. Nuclear is one of the few remaining options. ",
A few buzz words from the past: Chernobyl. Fukushima. Forgetting history means we are doomed to repeat those mistakes. ,
Can you elaborate?,
I wouldn't touch them...,
Can't say I'm surprised.,
The people making over 50 million dollars in this country are creating jobs for others and overall are contributing much more to society than they are taking away. This tax would be ridiculous and unfair.,
"I disagree. There are more security measures in place, but we are far from secure. There are so many ways that terrorists can threaten and kill us. foreign and American terrorists.",
What sort of world affairs are you referring to?,
opening the country would help out small businesses and not the big blue chip industries so i believe it would be going down. ,
Still makes me nervous,
But why is it a bad idea?  Sounds pretty good to me.,
lol.  Absolutely!,
I don't necessarily agree.,
Interesting...  I don't know though,
I think that the Dow Jones's performance will be greatly affected by the results of the election later this year. I do not think that it will drop if Joe Biden is elected because people will be hopeful and willing to invest.,
"Also, I believe that even if Donald Trump were reelected, that would give people a sense of stability, which would also encourage them to invest in the economy.",
I tend to agree with you,
"agree with you 100% nuclear power is damaging in the long run. 
#environment #cleanenergy",
"This is one example why it is so important for the U.S. to take an active role in world affairs:
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-declines-join-global-covid-19-vaccine-effort/story?id=72770704",
We need to cooperate with other countries so that we can share in the important medical advances that they make. We can't afford to be left behind when we should be moving as fast as possible.,
agreed.,
IF Joe biden is elected... There is a very good chance he will not get elected. Even if he does He wouldn't take office until after the year is over so I don't think anyone will be clamoring to invest before that.,
Jack has it right.,
It makes absolutely no sense to try to withdraw from world affairs when the world is becoming more connected than ever.,
yup.  agreed,
"If we cut ourselves off and isolate from the world, we will regret it when we need help in the future.",
AGREED! What difference does is make if our economy is good right now when we are killing the planet for our kids and grandkids.,
i don't know if i would equate a trump victory with stability. I think it will further divide the country and the dow will reflect that.,
"YES!!! Give people the option. 
#medicareforallwhowantit",
true.  thanks to trump.  sigh.  need to vote him out of office!,
Waiting for Trump to help us? That's gonna be a long wait. ,
Taxing people who make millions of dollars at high amounts just creates a disincentive to working harder and making more money. It stifles innovation and entrepreneurship.,
you don't agree that the environment is suffering? ,
"I disagree as I believe that Congress will pass more legislation enabling more rounds of stimulus checks sometime this year, and that will encourage people to invest.",
"While I don't think we should be turning a blind eye to world affairs, I would like to see us concentrate on us for once! Let's repair America!",
I do not understand why a wealth tax is needed since the marginal income tax rate is already so high.,
"@Kathryn_3504  People who make 50 million dollars do not get to take home 50 million dollars at the end of the day. The real amount of much, much less.",
"Yes, nature has been around forever and will continue to be around forever. But the state of nature will probably not be one that is hospitable to human life eventually if we keep neglecting and abusing it! #earthfirst",
"Upon further examination, I believe the U.S., WHO, and the CDC have over reacted with safety measures. Our chances of catching COVID-19 is only 1 percent. Let's open up the country now!",
The U.S. government has gone too far??? What? They haven't gone far enough! The number of Covid deaths and infections in our country is a travesty.,
"yes, even though I think it is likely we could see another attack as bad...even an attack half as bad would be devastating and very likely.",
"I'm on your side. If we don't protect the environment, the environment won't protect us. We need to think long term here!",
interesting read! thanks for posting.,
"yes, how many things have sounded great and then later we find out how harmful they are. weed killer sounded great. Plastic sounded great. let's really investigate and think this through before we consume it.",
Why are you saying it is bad idea? What backs that up?,
Thank you Allison! If we don't protect mother Earth it doesn't matter how the economy does because we are going to spend countless billions or trillions trying to fix the damage global warming is doing.,
Thanks Allison! By being so myopic we are opening ourselves up to other threats. We need to be vigilant!,
"It just makes sense to me that the more you make, the more you have to pay in taxes. Isn't that how it works for us ""little folk?"" I'm not trying to take advantage of the rich, but I think they can give a little more. ",
"And how many rich are paying little or no taxes due to being able to take advantage of loopholes and such. I'm looking at you, Trump!",
I wish it was possible to view a different reality where we had different leadership...To see what the response and outcome of the pandemic would have been.,
agreed. so many are lulled into a false sense of security.,
"The ""tax cuts"" unfortunately were skewed towards corporations and the wealthy. Even Warren Buffet said he was surprised how little taxes he pays.",
"thanks. I know there are many problems in the world and we need to help, but I just want to concentrate on America for a while.",
These CEO's that are making outrageous salaries and getting insane bonuses at the expensive of the little people... I think it makes sense for them to give a little more back (in taxes).,
"Yeah, what Alison_5893 said.",
Yeah.  Wish it wasn't true but that's the way it is.,
Where's the money gonna come from?,
Could not agree more. I don't know why people are so against this.  Access to health care is a basic human need/right.,
I agree we need to save the earth now! Economic growth will catch up later,
Why can't we build an economy that doesn't destroy the planet? If the planet goes we all go... We need to live to even have an economy to worry about!,
I think it's going to be 20% lower at least by the end of the year. I don't think the country is going to keep giving it up to the big blue chip companies if things keep being handled the same way.,
i agree that we need to focus on us most!,
"i think that going to classes should be fine,you can still take the virus seriously and still live life",
"@kathryn_3504, would you be so concerned about the economy if you had a loved one pass away suddenly? Lives come first.",
I completely agree with you. No amount of economic growth is worth risking the health of our planet!,
"Eight million people are killed by tobacco each year, but no one is lo that concerned about that.",
"I don't like wearing a mask either, but it is vital that we do out of respect for others. ",
"I agree that the government has not done enough, on the federal level and state level. ",
I'm with you on this one. We have no idea how GMO affects us long term as there is not enough data. I want nothing to do with it!,
Makes me nervous as well. This is something that the government should not cut funding for and should put extra effort into new technology to help keep this country safe. ,
"I have to agree with you.  With everything going on, I wouldn't be surprised if it did worse than that.",
People who smoke do it to themselves though so that is not a fair comparison.,
I can't prove it!,
I should not have to wear a mask.  Why is it my responsibility to worry about others? They don't care about me.,
"I think for right now we should stay neutral. Maybe if a new leader takes office in November we could be more effective overseas, but at this point it's best to lay low.",
People are out of control. The government needs to do more to enforce the laws so that we can all stay safe!,
I should not have to wear a mask.  Why is it my responsibility to worry about others? They don't care about me. ,
I like the hashtag -- freakyfoods. lol,
I think that it is true since there is just too much to keep up with right now,
It boggles my mind how irresponsible people are. They need to do more to get things under control.,
People are out of control. The government needs to do more to enforce the laws so that we can all stay safe!,
I would also want the option to choose. Let the people decide!,
I couldn't agree more. How can we possibly help anyone else when we can't get our own act together?,
"So true. The ecosystem is a delicate balance. Without the animals, we are all screwed!",
I agree Alison. Before COVID I held the opposite opinion but we need to focus on what is best for our country to get back on track.,
They definitely are not doing enough. Look at the mass gatherings taking place all over the country. People think this whole thing is a joke!,
It isn't worth the damage we will cause the planet. What good is growth when the planet you live on is ruined?,
Things are not looking good. Hoping things will turn around but I won't hold my breath.,
I know someone who child went back to school and they shut down after 2 days. I don't understand this need to rush. It is inconvenient but contracting the virus is so much worse.,
The rich can afford to pay extra. 2% is a drop in the bucket compared to what they have.,
I agree. There are safe ways to reopen. ,
It's important that we start to level the playing field a little. ,
Scary!,
"With all the distractions, it is easy to become complacent. We need to keep our guard up.",
Definitely not enough study done to know its true effects. Better to avoid!,
I agree lets get USA in order first!,
"Oh no. I didn't realize that graphic would be so big! Well, at least it gets my point across? :)
#proudAmerican",
I agree lets get USA in order first,
It seems common sense. I'm surprised how many people in society don't agree with it. ,
Interesting how the Covid-19 lockdown has given us cleaner skies and lower greenhouse emissions!,
"This picture brings back so much emotion. I agree, we cannot lose focus or get complacent. ",
Yes! Even some billionaires support this tax to improve the economy.,
"Yeah, to all those who want to fix the world, let me just say that we will be able to do that so much better if we deal with our own issues first.  Also a #proudAmerican",
Both are important for the future of our children and their children and on down the line. Build the economy by encouraging businesses to be sustainable and invest in new areas that can help reduce the carbon imprint. ,
Stay safe and educate,
We can encourage businesses to invest in way to protect the environment. That way we are helping the economy and the environment.,
"Once these GMO's are in our environment that can not be recalled, scary",
Me neither. It's better to be cautious.,
"We do have a lot of issues to deal with, but I think we a great enough country to do more than one thing at once. ",
"I agree, but it it doesn't have to be just one thing.  The Green New Deal has show that by helping the environment we can grow the economy at the same time, it's a win-win. ",
"I couldn't agree more.  It you had a $1, who wouldn't give two pennies of it to help someone else out?   It's such a small price to pay. ",
I think this whole deep-seat racism argument is bunk.  This isn't the 1950s... we just had a black president and we have another black VP candidate. ,
"That's whack.  People have been eating GMOs for decades, ain't crowds of people dying.  You know who would be dying without GMOs? All the people who have been saved by drought resistant GMO wheat and other crops.",
"You got that right.  But how will people follow the governments rules when the speaker of the house is sneaking out to a closed salon to get a blowout, not wearing a mask?",
GMO foods use less pesticides to grow and are not as harmful to the environment as conventially-grown foods.,
"Do you have a link for that, I think it's good to be cautious but I like to see the research instead of just reacting, kwim?
",
"Do you have a link for that, I think it's good to be cautious but I like to see the research instead of just reacting, kwim?",
"I am terrified at the number of people that would be dead, if it weren't for GMO crops.  They thought we would run out of food when the earth hit 4 billion people, but thanks to GMO crops we are safely double that. ",
Right on!  #taxthewealthy,
"You got some proof to back that up? GMOs have saved millions for starving and greatly reduced pesticide use, which is makes them far more safe than non GMO.  ",
"Yeah, crazy.  I wish people would do better and I wish the government would do better.",
"Yeah, crazy.  
**I wish people would do better and I wish the government would do better.**",
That’s crazy! I thought all insurance had to cover COVID 100%?,
"oops. sorry about the double post. I **really, really* wish.  Lol.",
My 401k is loving it. ,
Mine too!,
Genetic manipulation of the seed does not affect quality of plant or fruit. Totally safe!,
"Wow, wind turbines!",
A happy medium would be nice. Balance safety and economic recovery,
A happy medium would be nice. Balance safety and economic recovery.,
That is scary!,
We are still in a recession! ,
"Yes, tax!",
Health vs economy! Of course numbers go up when testing goes up. ,
Yes but the efficiency and capacity is not there. ,
"Yes, and dealing with #climatechange should be first on the list! Economic growth is not an excuse for delay!",
"Yes, and dealing with climate change should be first on the list! Economic growth is not an excuse for delay!",
"How convenient virus comes on an election year, thank you China",
How do you propose we pay for universal health care? More taxes on struggling Americans?,
that is good even if you do not like it but keep others safe i nice!,
So true,
"It will yoyo with the upcoming election, but 30,000 year end, if  not before. Regardless of who is elected. ",
"Also, most existing nuclear power reactors are widely regarded as obsolete.",
We do need to clean up our house first!,
Interesting article,
"I agree, this virus is killing our economy",
"Agree, taking away our freedom",
Thank you China,
closed lower today but shares of major tech companies rose ahead of earnings,
"Yes especially jobs right now, reopen America!",
So much better on the environment too,
You only need to look at all the food products that are organic and non GMO verified to be aware that GMO's are harmful to everyone.,
I think I would not mind if I had over 50M,
"Yes, peace for the world",
Just what we need right now!,
All great alternatives!,
I think it's best to avoid GMO's. Unfortunately there are no federal mandates to label food items that contain GMO's. The best option to avoid them is to purchase organic and non GMO verified products.,
"Four years of America first has damaged global relations and cooperation. Come on America, be a team player!",
Would closing our borders keep us safe?,
"I agree, over response. Herd immunity is the key! Look at other countries and how they have remained open, while not sacrificing the economy. ",
Where did the 90% accuracy come from? I would love to see the statistical analysis and prediction methods. ,
I totally agree with you. We are responsible for the animals.,
Jamal there are so many loopholes. They made her take a flu test before a covid test and charged $700 just for that.,
Ever since I watched the Chernobyl miniseries I've been acutely aware of what could go wrong. I'd be VERY uncomfortable having a nuclear plant near where I live.,
"Interesting article, but simply be moderate and play it safe. We need to enjoy our lives and live free. ",
I really don't see the economy improving long-term without more stimulus.,
"I would support it above a certain threshold. For example Jeff Bezos has two billion dollars. We could tax him HEAVILY and he would never miss it, and that money could go a long way to help people who have been hurt by lockdown.",
I agree with Luke. I don't see much economic recovery happening unless things drastically turn around fast.,
I definitely don't hate this option but would really prefer for everyone to have access to healthcare at no cost. It's a human right. ,
What good would a wealth tax on the very few do for our overall economy and national debt?,
"I absolutely hate wearing the mask, it fogs up my glasses. But I believe in doing my part to keep people safe. I just hope we don't have to do it forever.",
That is awful. I am all for universal healthcare. I don't know how it will ever happen though. Both sides seemed to never be able to agree. ,
Besos and Gates have more than they can ever spend. We could tax them hard and they'd never miss it. It's disgusting to me that just a few individuals control so much of this country's wealth.,
"I think so too. I heard yesterday that the market recovery we have seen is based on the expectation of more stimulus, and that stimulus is nowhere in sight.",
"They should start handing out tickets and fines in my opinion, and when this happens on campuses they need to expel people.",
"Higher taxes may negatively affect the Dow, however. Money spent on taxes cannot be invested in businesses.",
I don't know. I don't see why it should be America's place to be the world's nanny or the world's police. We need to take care of our own people. Put the oxygen mask on ourselves before we help others.,
They aren't doing ANYTHING. America's covid response is a joke. The rest of the world is laughing at us and rightly so. ,
I like this attitude! ,
They will never even miss it. They will never even notice it is gone. These people have an inconceivable amount of money. The wealth gap in this country is absolutely ridiculous.,
I completely agree. Just one example is the homeless situation in this country. It seems very unethical and immoral to me to extend aid to other countries when we have so many American citizens struggling and in need. ,
It is definitely a better for our future generation to aggressively participate in global affairs in order to create a better world for generations in the future.,
I agree on the smart aspect. ,
"Rich people always find ways to pay less taxes, no need to push them too far.",
"I totally agree, we would look ridiculous trying to police another country or show ourselves as a model to follow when our cities are burning and our politicians are so divided that they are fighting like school children on the news.",
"Solar and wind are where we need to invest, no more talks of nuclear energy. Let's get on board with harnessing the wind and sun! ",
"Are you sure about that?  Respectfully, it is your job to say that international affairs are more important than domestic affairs.",
"How much of this tax would even go to those who need it. A tax, just to tax, is not ncessary.",
"The economy and the environment need to be equal priorities. Saving the environment can lead to new industries, boosting the economy. We can do both!",
"you have a good point Allison.
",
"We'd look like hypocrites policing the world while some of our cities are burning and politicians are fighting like schoolchildren in the media. Enough is enough, it's time to take care of our own nation and stop worrying so much about other nations.",
"The U.S. needs to take this virus seriously, we don't know enough about it in order to make informed decisions. Mask are a precaution, better to be safe than sorry. ",
i do not think they went far I think people just need more information,
"We should not have to pay more at all. We already have the funding. The current system is incredibly inefficient with how it allocates wealth. With the new system, the efficiency will SAVE us money long term.",
"Agreed, they make jobs and have a lot of wealth that is capital, not just money sitting around.",
We will save money from how efficient universal healthcare is. That way health care isn't dependent of someone's JOB which can change all the time. Or those without jobs aren't screwed like they are now.,
Completely agree with everyone! Thanks for the comments!,
"Here we are safe. Here, we are free. Welcome to the USA.",
I totally agree. Things will quickly change when people start getting fined for their behavior.,
"Yeah, our focus right now is only on the current crisis. We have to plan better.",
"It is very sad that there are people forcing kids to go back to school, even though we know for a fact that Covid cases are going up right now. We need to at least make students and teachers use online platforms again. ",
"Disagree strongly. In order to fix our problems, we must be more involved globally. Understanding our issues requires global support. You can't fix climate change alone.",
"America has over 190,000 deaths, the worst in the world. This is a failure of our health care system and the people in charge who ignored what was happening globally. Wearing a mask is the least we should do.",
"Its will be affected by the presidential election, but if Trump gets reelected, He can fix our economy to what it was 2019. Polls show that he is in the margin of error. ",
Whats your favorite GMO? Mine is bananas with Corn being in 2nd.,
"There have actually been long term studies. Corn was the first GMO ever produced. You need to be a little more specific if you want labels because if you look at what corn originally looked like, you can say we have engineered them for the better. ",
"Exactly, Lucas, we pride ourselves on being the best in the world but we've failed miserably this time.  We need to do better, and I'm looking at our current president and his cohorts.",
"Massive disorganization and mis-communications.  If the government expects people to do their part, the government needs to do its part. Guidelines have been unclear, not at all uniform, and poorly enforced.  180,000 dead is not a joke, people.",
Our economy is suffering massively due to this!,
"If the Corgi can wear a mask, then SO CAN I  ",

We have more than 6 million cases and it's safe to say we suck at it. ,
"The truth is we didn't save the economy yet we also have the most cases in the world, which is pure nuts.",
"Totally, it's nonsense to me.",
Totally agree with this. ,
"Yup, but there are people starving now.",
It's hard to understand how we're the only one of wealthy countries that does NOT have some kind of universal health care and that we think that something is wrong it.  I simply can't comprehend why we can't do this.,
Let me know what you think!  When will this attack happen?  How soon?  Why is the US not doing anything about it!,
"Not totally agree, we should be the lighthouse of humanity. ",
Shouting won't make your version of truth be actually true.  And Trump won't either.  The economy simply can't recover that quickly from everything that has hit it this year.,
Sad but true.  Don't see how it could be otherwise.,
How can we find another clean and reliable energy?,
I'd rather have an honest but depressing portrayal of things than someone who's painting happy but completely unrealistic pictures of what's happening.  I have to agree with your assessment.,
@Jamal_3487 I could go on all day about examples of deep seated racism.  I'm happy for you that you've never seen or experienced any.,
Thanks Trump!!,
I agree with the original post that we'll be in a much better place for helping out other countries if we are stronger at home.,
YES! YES! YES! Can't agree more.,
Can you direct us to this poll? I want to see the number of people polled and from where they were polled.,
"Lol, Cody_5364, EXACTLY. :-)",
How can humans care for animals in great detail if their livelihoods are in danger from economic collapse?,
Proof is essential before making assumptions. But it would be good to see the scientific data for both arguments. ,
"The amount of money generated on the very few would barely put a dent in our problems. There are better ways to generate money than to tax people, even the ultra wealthy. ",
"I agree, but you haven't give us a reason why? In order to get people on your side, you need to give evidence to support your claim. ",

Do you even understand what GMOs are or do you just use buzzwords to try and scare people. SMH,
"Just because it is Harvard, other universities should close? ",
Funny thing is we could solve a lot of those problems by working with other countries. We are not unique in our problems. ,
I could not agree more. It's just too risky in my opinion. ,
"This is ridiculous, if we're not keeping track how will we even know if we need to tighten restrictions or if it really is ok to loosen up? It seems a basic minimum to at least track what is happening.  ",
"Well said! We are all big boys and girls. Give us some guidelines and then let us decide what we want to do. Stay out of my mucous membranes! I can read and discern. If I suffer consequences, at least they're MINE to suffer. BACK OFF!",
"Nuclear energy *is* the less harmful energy source, lol.",
I would have to agree with my fellow Americans. The federal government has wasted months doing nothing to prepare for the upcoming fall/flu season!,
That sounds like socialism to me! ,
"There is a lot to address at home, as we should. But we also have to keep our place on the world stage to prevent Russia's continuous power grab.",
"Agree, they need to let the people make our own choices!",
"Yes, Girl! Agree",
"We really need the people with billions to do more for our country instead of pay taxes, that would help on all levels.",
"I Agree, my dude! They need to chill on all the mask mandates and fear-mongering. Staying home and washing hands is enough, if it's my time then nothing will prevent it,",
"I totally agree. This is a dumb idea, not thought out well at all!",
"I can't fully agree with this one. We need to take care of ourselves first, but also put some resources into world affairs to keep our interest safe.",
"With all the money going into the system and to businesses, the market will just keep going up. That's how it works these days, it doesn't have anything to do with the economy or even the president.",
"I agree up to a point. There has to be balance, with the top priority being maintaning our habitat first, our economy second.",
"I agree up to a point.  There has to be balance, with maintaining our habitat, and our economy a close second.",
A strong economy can come up with technology like efficient clean power that will also help the environment.,
"Have to agree, U.S. involvement in world affairs is necessary to ensure world peace and protect our interest outside of the country.",
Sounds good in theory but I bet it will lower the quality of healthcare and increase wait times in the long run. It will be a huge bureaucracy.,
"Just the world ""nuclear"" makes me leery when considering it as an energy source. ",
Once the government passes more stimulus the market will shoot higher!,
"I agree, imagine having a great economy but the planet can't grow enough food to feed everyone. OF course the rich people will be fine as usual.",

@Jenna_214 Here is the link: https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/497356-poll-majority-of-americans-say-that-federal-government-not-doing-enough-to,
Although this is all speculation and very unlikely to happen ,
"Dow went down 1,000 points today. But we need to learn the stock market is not the true test of the economy. It's a game for the rich.",
searching for the pic was depressing and brought back lots of memories. thought it would be too much for me to post a pic of the actual towers on that day.,
It will recover as we go into the long weekend. Enjoy Labor Day.,
"I do not think that,that is a good studied mostly because we do not know the time,and the best on mice should be tested on others to provide variatibility ",
Its hard for a malignant narcissist to care about anyone.,
The rich will just figure out a loophole and never pay it anyway. Their politician friends will make sure there is a huge loophole in any tax that is applied to the rich.,
"they think if we act like the pandemic is over, it will go away. I'm scared of the flu+covid combo coming this winter.",
"Everyone deserves to have healthcare, but I don't know if socialized medicine is the right way to go. So many downsides...",
You are right! The US is coming unglued. We need all hands on deck here on our soil! ,
Not sure it will matter even if a viable plan was set into place when half the people care more about themselves than the health of the country.,
"The environment! If we don't protect the environment it won't matter if the economy is good or bad. We'll all be dead. It would be nice to have both do well, but when picking one I go with the environment.",
Agreed. It is just matter a time. Everyone seems to have forgotten that terrorism is a real threat to our country. I don't know how soon...But it will happen.,
The market is detached from reality. Wait until the bankruptcies start showing up!,
"Yep, it will come back. What goes down, always comes up. In 2008, mine took major hit - but that turned out to be the time I made the most gains in my IRA. ",
"I agree.  We need to shore up our social security programs, the elderly need them and the rest of us will someday too.",
"I completely agree, but it's so difficult to get people to make small sacrifices in order to have long term gain.  Ideas how we can help this happen?",
"It's sad that everyone is in such a rush to get ""back to normal"" that we're doing things in such a haphazard way.  The government needs to start doing its job.",
"Definitely not enough.  They've failed handling the first wave, they're not even thinking about a second.",
"He's not.  We're on our own, people.",
"I don't know, yes, America has problems, but have you SEEN some of these other places?  We're the richest country on earth, certainly we can do both.",
"Right you are, Willie! I shudder to think of the unforseen consequences of our greed for high profit foodstuffs!",
Two percent is nothing to them and it would make huge differences in other areas when put to good use.  Definitely think this is a good idea.  #wealthtax,
"As much as I think the word ""unprecedented"" is overused lately, that's exactly what we are in, unprecedented times.  I think we haven't yet begun to see the tip of the effects of this pandemic and I'm much more pessimistic than you.  It's going down.",
"Just sick, isn't it?",
"I think it's possible but not likely.  Security measures are great, but they have their limits.  Working towards greater stability in countries where terrorists are thriving would be a good start.",
"@Cody_5364, omg, legit thot it was a cat.  :D  Lol.
",
"Somehow I feel like, you know, we're the richest nation in the world, we can do both?  But I hear you.",
"It makes me kinda mad that Fauci is some bigwig and has been respected for years by scientists and politicians of both parties, and Trump is trying to make him out to be some kind of charlatan.  Government certainly hasn't done enough.",
These pictures frustrate me to no end. What are people thinking? It's not a joke and they need to face consequences. ,
i think we do need to make america first and work on our own stuff and get back to coming together.,
i think it would because it would help the communities that they are in,
the president can only do so much it is the Mayors and senators of those cities and states  that must mandate people to use mask.,
"Here is the proof that we have been doing this for centuries. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304423816305829

"LOL, I didn't realized that I uploaded this twice. The site was giving me issues and I thought it wasn't a successful upload",
"i think the students are doing the best they can to cope with it,adding further stress to them is not a good idea due to their mental health",
I hear you and it started yesterday with the tech stocks! Another sell off today!,
"The environment not only depends on the actions our country takes, many countries must also take this initiative, we alone will not be able to save it. On the other hand, our economy depends on us, that is why we must solve our problems first.",
"Balance is the best idea going forward in overseas relations, in my opinion",
I agree. I think we should phase it out as more clean energy is utilized.,
I definitely think more studies need to be done. There's a reason for the dramatic rise in autoimmune disease.,
it doesn't have to be and shouldn't be all or none. the all or none approach in most situations is not the best one and usually not one that yields the optimum outcome. leave all or none to action potentials. ,
"Agree, Thank you Trump!",
Interesting. Can you elaborate? ,
"The environment not only depends on the actions our country takes, many countries must also take this initiative, we alone will not be able to save it. On the other hand, our economy depends on us, that is why we must solve our problems first.",
"The environment not only depends on the actions our country takes, many countries must also take this initiative, we alone will not be able to save it. On the other hand, our economy depends on us, that is why we must solve our problems first.",
"Wow, its interesting to see how many studies are flawed. I still think not enough testing has been done but it is an interesting article",
"I agree. We definitely need to act now, before it is too late.",
"it's sad that so few people are aware of this. they just blindly go by a shoddily written pseudo 'plan' marketed by an uninformed, attention-seeking dummy",
"I agree with Heather_6355, both are important. ",
Agree with Amy_3504! World peace and prosperity need the help and guidance from the USA.,
The economy. The need it more than the environment currently.,
I agree with you. The economy matters more to my day to day compared to the environment. Great post Jacob!,
"I approve. Unless we are going to start paying workers a true living wage, the rich need to help out more. The worker bees allow the queen to thrive and should be treated as important as the really are.",
"Disagree. We can make both a priority.  We humans are adaptable, but we do need a safe habitat to survive.",
"Is it possible to do both? Can Trump, or Biden, strike a happy medium? Regardless, our economy is key!",
The Dow is up going into a long weekend. Are we going to push into value stocks at this point? The economy needs to remain stable for solid investing. ,
Where is the proof and logic behind this claim? We are more secure now then ever. ,
Mutants are great in the Xmen movies.  Not so much on our dinner tables!,
I just don't see the Dow going back up to its peak last February until we have a vaccine.  The pandemic makes everything too uncertain and the stock market reflects that uncertainty.,
Strong supporter of clean and efficient nuclear power. Safe and effective when highly regulated like it is in the USA. ,
"With all the economic uncertainty from the pandemic, just intuitively it does seem likely that the Dow isn't going to recover much til we have an effective vaccine.",
"I tend to disagree. While, I believe we do still need to keep a foot in the door, America has to come first. Our people are struggling.",
Really? That is surprising! can you share your sources?,
Can you expand on these thought? Why do you think this? What do you think will happen? What evidence do you have to share?,
The environment!!,
"I hesitate to believe the statistics, since there have been many articles highlighting findings of incorrect reporting.",
Yes GMO food is not safe!!!,
"I agree with Brad, show me more statistical data from trusted sources. ",
Environment. There will be no economy if we don't act quickly. Let's do our part to stop global warming before it's too late.,
"Exactly right. Let's do our part. Stop the corrupt Trump regime. All he is able to do is spread fear, horror, and destruction. Let's get Biden in before it's too late. You go Claire.",
Where is the scientific/medical evidence showing the mutations/medical conditions that result from eating GMO related food? We are only manipulating seeds before crops are grown. ,
Totally agree with this.,
Economy of course. it's our current way of life!!,
The economy is currently effecting us and needs more help than the environment.,
"Thank you for this informative article, Jacob!",
"I agree with both Brad and Jenna, need to show primary sources to be believable. ",
What is American culture? Isn’t it a mix of global perspectives given our diverse population and immigration history?,
Headed back up today! Come on Dow!,
"This is scary.  If we don't do something soon, there might not be a safe world for humans with an economy to help.",
But look at what's being put into our foods.   Sometimes insecticide particles with structural similarities to Ricin - who wants to eat that?  https://nutritionstudies.org/gmo-dangers-facts-you-need-to-know/,
It's sad that so many animals are losing their homes because of climate change and human activities. we really need to take more action to protect them,
 yes! fire trump...he is ruining the world,
"Here's an article showing the other side of the story, from a plant biologist https://nutritionstudies.org/gmo-dangers-facts-you-need-to-know/",
Yikes!  Not many Americans are in a position to come up with that kind of money to pay for their medical treatment.,
It seems like there hasn't been nearly enough testing yet - check out this article https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1070817/,
"I agree with you Brad, it seems like a lot more testing should be done, especially to get a better idea of potential long term effects.",

#They NEED each other. 

- Both! We can't have an economy with a bad environment, we'll all die. ",
# They need each other!,
"You might be right, except...  
  
- The U.S has the most powerful millitary in the world.  
  
- Targeting us is a suicide mission, and even then it's still hard.  
- We are the safest place to be and haven't had a war on our homeland for centuries.",
"Why do we have to choose? There's LOTS of money to be made in developing climate solutions, clean energy and the like!",
"They are safe, and ""natural"" ingredients are a big marketing scam. ",
Hard to relax and enjoy the weekend with so much volatility in the market.,
That is just insane. I sympathize and agree greatly. ,
"It is true that nuclear is the cleanest energy source we have that provides very little waste. Its a huge risk for the environment, however we have better technology and safety requirements enacted now that would eliminate the risks we had in the past. ",
"The economy. If we don't pay people to me motivated to work for protecting our environment, they will continue to be neglectful. They will only act when it is far too late",
Wishing you the best luck!,
That is SO AMAZING! Thx.,
"Great points, I agree that this is true. ",
"I agree, Trump and is Admin are igniting the flames of the **Fact- denying** populism.

COVID is causing all this havoc. Great facts.,
Great job posting **EVIDENCE** :),

"I couldn't agree more, thank you Heather!",
"The spread is out of control, policies need to be mandated on the national level to stop the spread of COVID 19 and protect the people living in this country, U.S.. ",
"The U.S. needs to remain involved on a global level because things that happen in other countries can, and likely will, have an impact on the U.S.. External problems can become internal problems, ex. COVID. ",
yeah. ppl are basing their anti-nuclear antipathy on preconceived notions and drivel concocted by a brainless fool aka aoc,
"When Trump said America First, he really meant it, now we are no.1 in Covid-19.",

Yes they are,
"sort of agree with you, don't forget Russia",
"I agree, the policy is too harsh",
All we need is voting in Nov.,
"Totally disagree, America thrives on globalization. ",
"No, we can't do both well. If the environment goes south the economy will soon follow.  We must take care of the environment first. ",
The environment will have a good impact on the economy?  When?,
The economy. We can't protect the environment if people are worried how they will keep a roof over their heads and food in their belly,
"Sea ice melting, change in weather patterns and the worsening of wildfires are proof climate change/global warming is real. We need to make changes now to save or planet. ",
POTUS makes our country like a joke. ,
Good luck!,
I think they are fine and science supports it!,
Very informative post. I agree biotech is relatively safe.,
"Personally, I think absolutely yes we will!",
"We have much bigger problems than a terrorist attack within the next 10 years, we need to focus on repairing our economy and keeping China from further destabilizing us. ",
Really fear the radioactive waste produced by nuclear energy. Would prefer the use of renewable energy sources. ,
I totally agree! It's scary to think of all the ways it could go wrong.,
"I agree, we need to do much more to protect the environment than we currently are.",
"Yes, let people opt in or out. Something must be done!",
"Well, while you are off saving the world, I hope we have enough military here when we need it!",
"I agree, it's going to be worse than the recession 10 years ago. ",
"Who is going to listen to us when our cities are burning, our small businesses are closing down for good, and our politicians are fighting like school children in front of the world? We need to tighten up at home and then try to save the world.",
we need jobs and the economy though we also need to be cognisant of the environment to some extent,
Thanks Luke!,
I understand covid is bad and highy contagious but we can't keep our economy shutdown. People are dying of suicides and addictions and domestic abuse too.,
"It's so scary to think you could lose almost everything, just by tripping over a curb and breaking an ankle.",
Not good on the nasdaq nor the dow today though it's not down as far as it was earlier,
"They are safe to eat, people just hear ""genetically modified"" and get nervous.",
In agreement...tax reform needs more careful thought than just saying tax the wealthy,
With covid I feel we have let our guard down and open to terrorists,
[Check out this post for REAL evidence](http://dartpost.org/posts/599/),
Clean energy needs to come from various sources and implemented over years. Otherwise regulation and costs will kill many businesses.,
"Yes it is time to restart the economy, schools, EVERYTHING!  Thanks.",
Certainly agree!,
How do You suggest we pay for socialized medicine? ,
"Just beginning, hard to know what will happen next but I'm not very optimistic

"Both, it's a balancing act.",

"It was a much better alternative to coal, but compared to wind and solar, not a good option.  Going forward I think we should phase out nuclear and go completely green.  And I say this as someone who's lived in a nuclear accident zone.  ",
This is crazy.  How can the government not do more to keep people safe?,
"agreed.  Stay safe, people!",
"Aw, that house makes me sad, but you've got a point there.",
@Dustin_3915 What is your source for this? It seems random to speculate about how vaccines are related to the stock market.,
"Lol, I can't keep track of what month it is, seriously.  Covid got the whole year mixed up.",
"@Heather_1039 You mention a lack of evidence, but then state that this recession will be worse than the one 10 years ago. Do you see the irony?
",
At least CNN is a credible source. Others seem to make things up as they wish without actual evidence.,
I would need to know more about specifically how the taxes collected would be used. Many times we hear about these taxes but don't actually see where the money is going.,
"@Hannah_8848  You can't really say that the rich never pay their taxes. If that were true, how would the government collect enough money to pay for anything?

"@Jenna_5040  The wealth gap is enormous because of our capitalist system. If we want to prosper through capitalism, we have to accept its faults as well. We can't have it both ways.",

China is getting away with too much these days. People need to pay attention before it is too late.,
My parents depend on Social Security and we need to save it.  I think a 2% tax that would help fund Social Security is a great idea,
That is so sad.  We need to do better to protect people!!,
"Agreeing with Heather_1039, it's a bit hypocritical to tell people how to run their countries when we clearly are having issues with ours.",
"Thank you for your valuable comments, Amy and Heather!",
why does it take a pandemic to get us to have cleaner air?,
"I understand the need everyone has for healthcare, however; who is going to pay for this plan. As it is medicare and social security is underfunded. Obamacare ended up not working well and doctors/hospitals certainly don't support universal healthcare. ",
"Jacob_5538 and Carly_8867 why does it bother you that everyone would have access to health care?  Other rich nations spend far less than we do on health care and have better results.  To me that sounds like a wise use of resources, not socialism.",
"This is just wrong, man. The government needs to do something.",

"Jenna_214, the government has money for what it decides is important.  They just haven't decided it's important.",
Year to date net change in the dow is .1% so I am not sure your source of stats for the 20%. Basically your model predicts by 12/31 the Dow will decline 20% from today.,

He had to throw it out cuz it was Obama's plan.  ,
"If I had stocks, I would be too!",
the environment is most important! The economy will catch up! There will be no economy without the environment.,
Yes! I have a feeling it is going to go down this way too!,

I agree with you Amy. I am not risking the health of my children when it comes to GMOs. I have seen some studies and it is quite frightening.,
Wow... What a discussion we have created!,
"I agree with Willie, we are playing catch up. Regardless of the numbers, we all know things are trending in the wrong direction.",
I'm very interested in the alternative energy sources that are in the works. Nuclear power can't be the only way of the future.,
The US can barely take care of themselves. Sometimes it is better to focus on the task at hand rather than spreading yourself too thin.,
I must say yes they are!!,
These people are making marginally more than they probably should in the first place. 2% is more than fair price to pay for people of this caliber.,
Putting anything modified genetically into our bodies doesn't sound like a good idea to me. I say no thanks!,
Balance! We can strive for both while we bring our economy back alive. ,
"I agree with Carly
Never saw a need to buy a GMO, so many other options that I trust and enjoy.",
"Yes, please elaborate in how your family was almost homeless?? If we continue to choose economy over the environment, we will be destroying our home. ",
"We have to look at these forms of energy, they are so clean and ubiquitous. ",
"The environment
 but I feel like having both is achievable ",
Very informative! Definitely info everyone needs to know,
lol,
This is true. Just look at the fires in California. Many people can't even insure their homes. They can't get loans. Soon many will be homeless...because of the environmental damage we are causing.,
I agree,
I agree with this ,
The government should do more to prevent this ,
"Trump is just saving the economy, the environment just has to suffer a little more.",
Wouldn't we all feel dumb if we found out the numbers aren't what they seem.,

Make America Dead again. Thanks Trump.,
"He literally is trying to undo everything that Obama has put into place before he leaves office (well, let's hope he's leaving)",
"I agree with this, but I really wish that GMOs were a sure thing. It could really change the world, but I know I'm not willing to take that risk. ",
"Seriously, they will never miss 2% of their income. How can they stand by and let people live in poverty when they have more money than they will ever need. ",
Why can other countries do it but the United States can't? It's just baffling to me.,
"No No No, you should trust scientists. ",
I'm going with bad until we have more evidence and many more years of data to prove me wrong. There is just not enough information yet. ,
That's heart broken news ,
"Amen, 60 more days of damage is 60 days too long.  Get him out of the White House!!!",
This can't be overstated....GMO's have only been around for 20 years.  There really are very few long term studies even available.  Food for thought.,
"Great stuff, I'm THIS close to changing my mind about the environment. But nah, economy>environment for me.",

"The less in debt we are, the more we can help our people!",

"I'm also going with bad. It's not natural, it can't be better for us.",
We definitely need more testing on GMOs. The info and research we have on them is still limited.,
"This fear of Big Brother taking away your insurance is not a fair argument. Our health care system is broken, even with the progress of ObamaCare. Medicare for All seems like another positive step.",
Interesting research. Thanks. Still learning about GMOs.,
"i agree, but no more stupid wars. us needs to work with other nations to get china and russia under control. ",
bro you've been misinformed. it's not an either or situation. both can be done. just take a look at how profitable solar energy and wind power companies were before djt. btw more coal factories have closed under djt than they did during obama's admin,
Eliminate Medicare!,
We need an affordable option health care option available to everyone. Medicare is a step in the right direction.,
What an interesting article. Thank you for sharing. Research like this opens your eyes. The food industry is more concerned with earning as much profit as possible and not about the safety of their products.,
"yeah but i guess they don't care otherwise they would not be cozying up to djt, they'd be demanding that he do something even tho we all know that he won't do anything non-destructive  even if he were able to do so",
Wait it's got fructose in it? :thinking:,
:thinking: supposed to be 🤔,
Why would GMOs cause mutations? That doesn't make sense to me.,
ha ha .... but everywhere I go I see discarded masks and gloves on the ground!,
Interesting read!,
Like like and more like!!,
Agreed!,
You are probably right!,
Of course there is.  But it will probably never happen...,
"Yes, thanks for the reading.  This was interesting",
American is a big country and our government is so inefficient. Medicare for all sounds like bureaucracy and bloat.,
"GMO’s do not cause mutations. Their own genomes are manipulated, but they turn out to produce safe and effective food. ",
Okay but economic growth is essential for everyone's lively hood so...,
Well this is scary.  What do you think we can do about it?,
"Sad and unfortunate.   And yes, largely the government's fault for not doing more.",
Excellent points Malik! Thank you for your post. ,
They should pay for our help.  Why should we help for free,
Looking back we may be shocked that we allowed GMOs to exist. That's why I stay away from them. ,
so you would rather people literally die?  health care is essential!!,
I think buying into Medicare is a viable solution. I hope it gets some traction in the coming years. ,
"I agree, while there is bloat in government. Medicare for all would be a bright spot because it would help save lives.",
Wonder how many officers have actually been infected.,
"I agree, when it comes to the environment, we need to look out for future generations. Saying that economic interests should take precedent is a selfish outlook. ",
I agree,
What do you think we can do about it?  Anything?,
"funny, but not informed.",
"That's interesting, thank you",
Try [this site](https://gmoanswers.com/) !!,

Maybe this will convince the government to help people who lost income and jobs. They seem to pay more attention whenever the market goes down!,
I agree with you Jamal!,
"Sorry other jacob, but you are wrong today.
",
"we only have one earth, we have to protect it at all costs. ",
Our health care system is broken. How do you propose we fix it if you don't see the solution right in front of you?,
"I don't think so, yet the system needs an overhaul",
We need to protect people's health. Sick people who can't afford health care are going affect all of us in the long run.,
Yes the gap in wealth is obscene in this country.,
"Our health care system needs a major revamp. Medicare should be an option for those who want it, not free for everyone!",
"We should be free to purchase our own insurance if we choose to. However, there must be a better way to offer affordable healthcare to those who need it but can't get it.",
You'd think that we could come up with ways to help the environment AND the economy by coming up with the right incentives.,
Debt-free? Only Bill Clinton came remotely close (yet still far off). He was able to leave office with a budget surplus...and then came Bush. Sigh. Medicare should be an option for all.,
"I agree with you both. Altering the genetics of anything doesn't sound like a good idea to me. Until more research has been conducted, I am staying clear.",
We may not have an economy to worry about if we don't get Global Warming under control. Scary to think about.,

Very interesting. And scary. Thanks for the 411. And thanks to Breaking Bad for teaching me  what Ricin is...poor Lydia!,
And yeah I am afraid of the market going down. It went up so fast.,
Can't wait to get rid of Trump. I feel sorry for the next few presidents that have to clean up his mess. It'll take a truckload of Lysol wipes to clean his stink out of the whitehouse!,
"Agreed, we all need to get together to vote him out to restore peace to both America and the world AND nature!",
"dunno, there may be a few more important things, like, maybe, ... human lives?",
"PS I think that is an actual chart of the stock market over the next year or so, lol",
I agree so much.,
COVID is scary. Even if you don't die from it it can damage your lungs or organs permanently. I don't love the police but we need to take this disease more seriously. The government needs to get it's sh*t together ,
"You must've been saving this joke for the right moment lololol
But I don't think this was the right moment",
Couldn't agree more. We must do what's right for the planet or we risk losing it all.,
Scary stuff,
yeah now there are more terrorist groups to be aware of and require monitoring. 911 could have been averted if scotus hadn't robbed gore of the electoral win. wonder if the future will model itself on the past,
maybe you should learn more about gmos before declaring them as mutagenic....,
that is not true! GMOs aren't natural watch out!!,
I do not think they are bad I just do not think we are looking at information over long periods,
i think we can do medicare for all.just look at how much we spend as a nation in insurance alone.we need universal health care,
it just really shows how much we spend at work instead of being with family or friends,
Agree with all the comments. We have to save our planets.,
"If somebody asks ""where do you live"", you tell them where your house is, not where your job is. So if you LIVE at home, are you DEAD at your job?

"wholeheartedly disagree, we need to protect the planet. There is a win win scenario here, we dont have to allow greed to overpower our need to preserve the planet for future generations. ",

Its sad and tragic how government has failed its citizens. ,
I think the healthcare system will suck the government dry and we'll all have to pay for it on top of our existing healthcare costs.,
"Agreed there is little doubt whats going on with climate change. People that want to rape the land, just refuse to accept the facts.",
i do not think so there is so much going on over the world that people have their own issues to deal with,

I would support it. They can easily afford 2% .,

i do not think that is good for them and will indeed hurt them in the long run,
We're one of the world's wealthiest nations yet we have such levels of inequity. We have to be able to find a way to do this.,

GMO foods has been altered with enough dose of pesticides and growth hormones. How can we certify this as safe for consumption as the Government claimed. I feel it's contaminated and might not be perfectly safe. ,
Avoiding GMO foods makes you safer. ,
This is really staggering and eye-opening. Covid-19 really is scary and needs to be taken seriously. What is our government doing?!,
"While it is important to support the environment, it is equally as important if not more to preserve and strengthen the economy, especially in times of economic turmoil and COVID still looming.",
We have the power to make a change. Let's protect our planet and heal our world at all cost. We owe our future generations a safe environment to live. ,
"If we don't protect the environment, we might one day go extinct. We only think economic growth in a healthy environment. Living in an unsafe world will bring no thought of economic growth... ",

Amen Claire. (Heather is right too),

that makes no sense @Claire_8713. You can't compare dog breeds to what we eat and how it will effect us. ,
This is really sad. The government should be protecting the front line and should be ashamed they aren't doing enough.,

I'm afraid the economy won't get back on track until we have a vaccine.  The pandemic creates so much uncertainty.,
So sad :(  I worry about all first responders and healthcare workers.  They shouldn't be paying the ultimate price for our country's failure to contain the virus.,
"I think with our massive losses from the pandemic and our current economic situation, it might be best for the long term if we can focus on our own recovery for now, to put us in a stronger position to be able to help the rest of the world later.",

GMOs are already in our food. The horse is out of the barn. It is too late to fight to keep them out. That is the sad truth. It is the conventional versus organic debate all over again and will have the same result: choice for the consumer.,

true...very slow to act,

"While I think that GMO's probably are bad, I don't think there is any turning back and I don't think they are as bad as some people say they are.",
Ha ha very funny.  Will you still be laughing when loss of genetic diversity caused by GMOs results in widespread crop failure?,
Jamal_3487 I am shocked at your response about racism. I would love to hear more about it from you.,

I would argue that security will be even tighter leading up to the November election and limitations of movement during the current pandemic. ,
I would certainly believe that this is possible. I think that would be the case with any frontline profession - not just law enforcement. It is staggering to think that the number could exceed the 9/11 law enforcement deaths.,
That's the state government. Florida has always been shady and sinister in their dealings with state and country. The state's citizens need to vote them out. But I think the Federal Government has gone way overboard on the COVID restrictions. ,

Great tip! xD,
We should be able to prioritize both!,

I kinda agree but I feel like other factors are involved as well,
:( our government needs to step up ,
Ha! That's hilarious. And not a surprise at all. Score 1 for the environment!,
We can do both! Just don't panic. The DOW has already regained a lot of its momentum and will continue to. Have faith in the DOW and start being kinder to Mother Earth.,

I agree we need to take care of what we live in and we need to think long term not short.,
I agree I mean how you seen how much trash we make each year on just products alone,
I do not know why they would not follow or at least see the last presidents suggestion that they can do better? they had 8 years worth of information and guidelines but threw it out due to party affiliation.,
that is true I can makefunny faces to myself without feeling weird about it!~,
there is always a worry but we do not know until it happens it can go down or even up.,
while we should take care of the economy we also need to take care of the environment and stop choosing provide over care of nature,
Don't think so. It's already recouped most of what it lost. Will it be down? Probably. By 20%? Nah.,
We've already had the crash. We are in the recouping phase.,
i think there is but I think that it should be lower if you are in private insurance so you do not pay so much,
HAHAHAHA.  serves them right,
We are living on borrowed time. Pretty soon there won't be any sand left for the White House to bury their heads in.,
so how do you suggest reconciling protecting the environment with economic interests?  Because that's important as well.,

interesting!,
"scary.  yeah I agree, not going away any time soon.",
I don't know...  Someone will likely come up with something.  But it's a little nerve wracking that because they are in such a hurry to develop it may not be entirely safe.  Chances are it will be expensive and not available to all as well...,
"not surprised, but yikes!",
"the health care system in America is broken,and we need to try something new because health care shouldn't be so much people pay over 400 a month just on insurance alone where most of that money could go towards their other bills",

just commenting to say this is a powerful picture,
"You think the economy is doing better?  How so?  I mean I suppose people are going back to work a bit more, but it's going to take years to recover from this.",
"deman to do better which we should of done last election but not enough people cared,and not enough still do not care  and the pandemic shows",
Why didn't America try to work with other countries to solve COVID19? This was not the time to go it alone.,
"i do think we need to work with others,it has to be a group effort because we are all human",
i think people are viewing china negative and I do not see how they are a  leader with how they handle their people,
Which begs the question: what do they do all day?,
I think they've been doing a good job. The sooner we get to herd immunity the better. No need for restrictions.,
this is a great look with how organized it looks and the colors really draw you in,
"If Medicare was available to all, the system would be forced to fix itself. As it is, medical care is unaffordable and there needs to be an option that allows anyone to apply for medicare if they do not wish to keep their private insurace. ",
I disagree. If the economy dies it won't matter if you have COVID or not.,
"Wow, what an alarming facts. Thank you for sharing. People need to be educated about this!",
this is not responsible at all and they should be more careful with everything going on,
"Wow, what a powerful graphic. Working together would help us be better as a global community.",
I agree whole heatedly ... Especially with terror threats that are constantly looking.,
"We may never know, Luke.",
This is why the government needs to calm down over restrictions. The economy needs to get back up and running as fast as possible. ,
Aren't there already too many restrictions in the US? ,
Agree with you so much. The devastation to the economy has been enough.  We need to scale back on restrictions right now.,
"Check out this article, y'all!",

Thanks for your replies!  It's a process Brad.,
"There definitely needs to be much more extensive testing, especially testing for long term issues like leaky gut and increased food allergies.",
"The pandemic and related restrictions definitely are causing a lot of uncertainty in the markets.  I sure hope things get back to normal once we have a reliable vaccine, but don't see that happening in the next few months sad to say.",
We might all be human but we have to help ourselves and make ourselves strong enough to help others.,

"If we all get out and vote Biden/Harris, we can feel rest assured he will reimplement everything he can that Obama started but Trump reversed. ",
I would not mind waiting either. Too many people go without healthcare and prescriptions. They thought of being sick and having to suffer because you don't have insurance is heart wrenching.,

"I agree with Diamond, probably won't be available to everyone, especially people without insurance. I anticipate long lines.",
I think the opposite at this point. We need to focus on our homeland right now and pull ourselves together before we can help other countries. That's not to say shut them out completely but we have a lot of work to do here first.,

Not really. Our weakened government (ALA Trump) is ripening for attack. Let's wake up before it's too late. Complacency won't help anyone.,

I feel so sorry for the vulnerable people in our world who were affected by this. Some lost their lives. They were let down by the system. The vulnerable or weak or the ones that need the most help.,
"Interesting data but this is from 2019, a little old? ",
I hope so! They should do the right thing and help people who need it.,
You nailed it Malik. The government has failed in comparison to nearly every other government in the world.,
Biden! We always need compassion and generosity but we especially need it NOW.,
It is already too late! But better late than never I guess...,
And people try to act like he is an evil mastermind trying to inject them with a microchip. smh,
The big hedge funds make money in any direction the rest of us should stay out of the casino.,
Trump sees right through this fake pandemic. He'll get the economy going again. You like jobs? Vote Trump!,
Many people could foresee this and did. Trump simply doesn't care.,
I agree. Spending time in nature is relaxing during these stressful times. Trump probably hasn't spent one day in nature.,
So sad and so unnecessary.,
"Sadly, Trump doesn't understand or care about world affairs.",
I don't want to cover my handsome face! Hello ladies!,
Buy the dip!,
"Remember in the very beginning when Dr. Fauci said the worst-case scenario was 100,000 deaths? Trump really mishandled this.",
But the situation is out of control. The death toll is estimated to double by January unless something changes. The government needs to get a handle on this ASAP.,
It is not enough to vote Trump out in 2 months. Think of how many more unnecessary deaths there will be by then. Someone needs to do something NOW.,
Terrorists exists on both sides!,
"They're young and healthy, the virus won't do anything to them.",
How much money does one person need? ,
This is such a simple act that anyone can do to save lives. I truly don't understand why some people refuse to comply.,
I'm gonna buy stocks AND toilet paper!,
"I agree, for the sake of our health and the health of plants and animals.",
Agreed. Let's be there for others so we're not alone when we need help.,
Yea I agree the risks far outweigh the benefits...,
That makes absolutely no sense. The government needs to set regulations and make sure everyone who wants to get tested can do so affordably.,
Yes we must stay the course and protect our nation! ,
The amount of confusion surrounding the disease didn't help in the early days. The government needs to do a better job of keeping the public informed so that we can take the right actions and turn things around.,
"The amount of misinformation coming from the government is overwhelming. We need change, that's for sure.",
Not having to use pesticides due to GMO means that the pests either don't want or can't eat the crop... doesn't sound like food I want to touch!,
"I hope you're right, but I wouldn't count on it. I hope the government is ready to handle what's to come.",
"One day, the government tells you one thing, then the next day they turn around and tell you the complete opposite. They need to get their facts straight before spreading misinformation.",
"If bioterrorism counts, then no!",
Why can't we protect both the economy and environment? ,
We have been warned!,
"Just because it doesn't kill you right away doesn't mean it isn't harming you for a slow death. Think cigarettes. It takes years before you see the effects but make no mistake, it will catch up with you eventually.",
Who's your candidate of choice then? Sleepy Joe?,
This is a good decision but virtual learning is still the safest choice. ,
"Like the idea of having an open discussion on topics, but this is too generalized. Bring something to the table.",
I agree 100%. Thanks for always having great posts. ,
Ya GMOs are dangerous and need to be closely monitored and watched. ,
They might help crop yields but they hurt our health. #BoycottGMOs,
I disagree. We are in a stock market bubble and it is due for a huge correction. ,
I think they will go down severely. We are in a stock market bubble with extremely inflated pe ratios. Sell your stocks!!!,
scientists can not be trusted. They are run by the left and the rich. Just like the climate change claims scientists can not be trusted!!!!,
This seems like fake news!!! Drain the swamp!,
"A government that doesn't take care of its citizens is not much of a government at all. Yes, we need a better health care system, but to rally against Medicare For All accomplishes nothing.",
they were able to become wealthy b/c they had the societal infrastructure to do so.,
The generation that destroys the environment won't be the one to face the consequences. This really hits hard,
"Wow, that's a harsh assessment but I think you're definitely right.  US deaths per capita is about to overtake Italy's.  ",
"@Jen Nah, I completely agree.  You know what they say about you can judge the character of a society by how they treat the weakest among them?  I think it's pretty obvious what that says about our government and about (many of) us as a nation.",
I agree 100%. It is maddening.,
We need to help those who don't have insurance. I fully support Universal healthcare,
Universal health care would guarantee basic care. Nobody would have to go without care because of a job loss,
having a handsome face is good but been alive and saving lives is the best.,
There would be greater control over costs and companies would not have to our of business because of the rising cost of providing health insurance to their employees,
Medication costs and provider services would be regulated and negotiated. No more big Pharma in control.,
"That is insane, if anyone else tried to mark up their essential services or goods that high, there would be public outcry for the government to step in.  Now?  Crickets.  smdh.",
This should be posted everywhere next to the masks required signs so people can follow directions. Good information.,
"@Coleman Stove, that is the most ridiculous statement I have ever heard and I'm sure you wouldn't be saying that if you saw your child laying in a hospital bed fighting for their life. ",
"Things are going to change once we get a new, respectable leader into the White House. ",
He literally rolled back everything that Obama set in place. This upcoming election is so important. ,
We are already seeing spiked in cases in colleges and Universities where mask wearing and social distancing are not being done. Each infected student can infect an older or sick person who is chronically ill or dead. ,
Both,
How is this even legal?  The government needs to intervene for the good of ALL of us.,
"Seriously, tho, China was supposedly a partner and we had public health people *in Wuhan* and look what we got.  I think we should just do our own thing, we have the best scientists working on it already.",
"Hmmmm, this is making me think, I have to admit my line of reasoning is ""how could they have known what was coming?"" but when I look at this it seems they dropped the ball.",
What makes us think anyone else wants a rushed vaccine?,
"No way.  (Ok, I admit it, I had to google Senegal to know exactly where it even is.) That's a pretty shameful thing for a superpower like the US.  Could we have pulled it off here?  Why didn't we?",
"I welcome the idea of enforcing facemask in public places, we need more strict policy to fight this pandemic. The federal government need to do much more better.",
"Fight for your rights, man.  Happy Labor Day to you too.",
Universal healthcare is a beacon of hope for those of us without good jobs.,
Perhaps consider adding more facts besides WSJ links....,
"Agreed, 100%. The U.S. is a scary place to be right now.",
Trump NEEDS TO BE STOPPED. He is a fascist dictator with only his OWN interests in mind.,
"58,209 died in Vietnam.  Not even a third of the number killed by covid.  This is some insane sh!t.  Why isn't the government doing more?",
"Biden's an idealist. Which is nice.  But not very realistic.  At this point we have enough problems at home, we need to work on those first.  ",
"I agree. You make perfect sense here. Carly is wrong, Allison is right.",
We used to be a beacon of hope but now we are a self-involved bully drifting toward fascism under the leadership of a madman who we seem unable to stop.,
Y'all gonna miss Trump so it's so convenient to blame him for every single damn thing. ,
"Car accidents kill WAY more people than terrorism. We still drive, though.",
Is it possible they're mostly just doing the wrong things?,
"True, While I'm not as pessimistic as @Arthur Pendragon I do think we need to prioritize our own problems at home.  ",
"What sorts of things does it need to do? Stronger things, or just different ones? Shutdowns appear like worse ideas than some 'weaker' responses like good contact tracing.",
Me too. I'm excited about nature today.,
Correct mask usage could help us a ton. It could really help us ease up COVID-related closures elsewhere.,
"I'll have to say that it's really hard to compare this stuff to my own job, too. My job isn't much like his.",
I'm still having a hard time reconciling this idea with the fact that overall economic performance looks...not bad for being in a pandemic.,
"I assume the issue people have relates to scale. It's tough to make solar or wind scale up in the right way. But, in the end, I agree that the risks of nuclear outweigh the reward.",
Not to mention how animals are treated. It is a crying shame.,
Fake pandemic? What do you mean Coleman Stove? (I used to have a Coleman Stove and I used to sell Furnaces for them some years ago..so I know what Coleman Stove is..).,
I just saw the news today. It looks like three of the four biggest wildfires ever seen in california are raging right now. Something has to be going on. Climate and fires need to be seen to right now. ,
Love to whack those moles.,
This is a bunch of garbage. I still worry about Frankenfoods. I'm not feeding them to my kids.,
"Wow, what happened? Are you ok now?",
The Fall of the American Empire: 2016-?,
I'm not so sure. Finland is a pretty small country. The population is smaller than some of our 50 states are. It may not translate. I assume now that is why Brad can't reply. He probably doesn't even believe it himself.,
The wealthy need to pay their share.,
"Agreed, he's really digging his own grave I think.",
"Yeah, lying is always a bad idea with these sorts of things. The real truth is best. Imagining that things will always be rosy, even when the rose colored glasses are shattered isn't a good plan.",
"Nice pic, but what's the date on this. Is it from 2019?  Dates are important here.  Also what ""social gathering"" is this? Trump rally perhaps?",
"Thanks for actually remembering what it's about. Most people really have no idea. It's just a sort of ""red box"" on the calendar. Your post should be required reading for kids being home schooled. Kudos.",
"I think you might be taking things a little too far here. There is no need to get people worried about something like this now. Just give it a rest. Focus on the environment, forget terror.",
I think we'd be in danger of more Terror if Biden was elected. Don't you?   Trump is law and order after all.,
Our leader is just getting us out of insanely bad deals. Give him a break.,
"Maybe the best thing is to just get the economy going first, leave everything else behind for a while. Let's just get every body back to work and school. People should stop going on about the Corona Virus.",
"I think I agree about global warming. I'm sorry to hear about your families home. I'm also worried. I am worried about wildfires, tornadoes and drought.",
I think we should stop global warming but stop short in being disrespectful to our president. He's working very hard to get things going. Let's just let him have another 4 years. What do you think?,
"First off, Trump never told that 17 year old to do anything. He was just protecting his neighborhood. He's a hero. Secondly, there is no real terror going on here at all. Just give it a rest. Stop over reacting.",
"Heather is right. We're doing just fine. Safer than ever. Elect Trump, Join with Heather_243 to reelect our strong leader.",
This post is perfect. Your math works out and is solid. You're my new favorite poster on here. Thanks Heather.,
"There's not much more they can do, without taking away our freedom and rights. They've done too much already, in my opinion. People need to protect themselves as best they can and hopefully we can get this over with quickly.",
"unfortunately, the govt isn't even trying to rectify the situation.",
education yourself before making claims like this. you're not making yourself look smart to put it nicely. ,
one can walk and chew gum. you can be involved in world affairs without neglecting domestic issues and without intentionally manufacturing wars that have no basis in reality. ,
"I generally follow you, can't you post items without cursing? ( I may have to rethink my following options after all)",
"While I want health care, and feel we should get it, I insist on having my body/soul here on Earth, ready for the rapture. ",
I'm for it.,
"I agree with Your view, which is the same as our Leader, Trump. He's trying to stand up to China. glad you are on the Trump Bandwagon (as far as standing up to and calling out China). Good Job Jacob",
How do you think Trump is supporting our markets. He's doing well right?,
Happy Labor day to you!,
"This seems a little dramatized. None of our presidents are anything but puppets, at least Trump is his own person.",
I'm intrigued by your point. Do you think Nuclear is safe enough? Is it moral? What will happen if there is a hurricane/tornado/tsunami/wildfire/riot?  What then?  I'm looking for anything that will save the planet.,
"This is disrespectful. Reelect Trump, he has a better plan.",
"Scott's right, Lets Make America great. ",
"Yes, we have to do something. I've heard this is the worst US fire season in history. It's time to act. There are many bible verses that support this.",
"Good point. We should all do our part. Let's come together on this issue. Stop global warming, Jesus would want you to.",

We can hope for that! I consider this virus from China terror though!,
I hope that is not true!,
Good question??,
wind and solar,
The election is just around the corner. Trump (and the Fed) will do everything they can to keep markets up. There will be another stimulus bill once the politicians quit taking sides. Americans need a swift and sustainable economic recovery. ,
Re-elect Trump!,
"I don't believe any numbers, as there has been so many incidences of mis-reporting.",
There are clean alternatives!,
"Couldn’t agree more, Luke. Taxation is not the solution. ",
Scary but whack a mole funny,
"I agree. I don't always agree with Trump's decisions, but he is a strong, independent leader, who is not ""bought"" by lobbyists.",
"We need to stop the bipartisan bickering and think of the American people.  Over taxing is not the solutuion, both both sides need to come to a compromise, whether it be a major stimulus package or tax breaks. ",
Seriously! It is disturbing and disgusting. Makes me wish I lived in another country.,
Yes agree Jacob!,
Crazy. I keep seeing things on the news. Tell us what's really going on now?,
wow,
"I agree. Great, factual post! Medicare for all, not for some!",
Take care of America first,
"Wow, I hadn't thought about things like that. I think you're right though. We have to give people a chance to buy in to Medicare if they want. If it's good enough for the house of representatives it's good enough for us.",
"I agree that we need to do better, but closing the country will not be the best solution. ",
Yes save the future,
"Great idea! Are you in any buy nothing groups? I joined one and it's great! I pass on things I don't need and pick up items I can use.

Agree with Bradley,
Need to Make America great again!,
Hmm I do wonder,

Too many of these reports calling GMOs safe are written by scientists funded by big agribusiness.  More rigorous testing and independent research is needed.,

"But what about the economy? We need to put in less restrictions so that people do not starve from being unable to get work due to so many businesses closing. Plus, people's mental health depends on being able to socialize and go back to normal.",
"Jamal, just look at the record. Trump has been rattling up mess. https://www.justsecurity.org/70419/ten-days-that-show-why-trumps-wrong-on-terrorism/ Check this out.",
"Agree, although we can also fight for multiple causes at once. Taxing the rich #2 would allow funding for additional programs, such as social workers and other non-violent interventions, that would assist with less police violence.",
"I agree.  The situation is totally out of control.  We need to really focus on solving our own country's problems and get through this crisis together, hopefully all in one piece.",
I will agree with Biden that having the US take a stronger hand in world affairs will make the US more secure and safer.,
I wonder if you've read anything compelling to support that point though?,
"Thank you so much!  The more I read about this stuff, the more worrisome it gets.  Stay safe out there!",
Thanks for the info. I'm considering your point.,
Hope there is no fire though?  Is there?  I'm safe enough here.,
Really sad.  The government should be funding these tests instead of spending money saving the rest of the world.  This is a major public health crisis.,
What is this graph? Is it Junior's homework? I can't make heads or tails of it and there are no descriptors on death's from what?,
"Wait, I think I figured this graph out. I bet it's New York state or City Corona Virus deaths. This actually does NOT prove your point Carly... I KNOW the death rate wasn't less than a hundred people for any of these dates, US wide.",
"we have to consider the environment before the economy, otherwise there won't be any point.",
Notice that India is NOW number one. Number one in deaths from Corona. We need to take care and wear a mask now.,
"Yeah, right. Just skype with granny one last time. She had quite a run. As long as we can go to the mall....she'll understand. She probably had it coming.",
this government lack the ability to be proactive in the fight against the pandemic.,
Most accurate depiction lol ,
More people should be talking about this ,
"I completely agree! It's not fair to them, either, to have to pay for their success.",
i agree,
They should really be more open on spending. Who knows how much is being embezzled? ,
"I agree with Biden, we need to be more invested in world affairs",
I agree Trump only cares about things that benefit him ,
"Between the pandemic and protests, there have been a LOT more than 1000 people dead...the terrorists don't need to do anything except sit back and watch us annihilate ourselves!",
"It helps increase food supply, but what about our health?",
We already pay tons in taxes and hardly see any of it. How do we know taxing the rich won't just pad the pockets of other wealthy people?,
I think is very unlikely ,
It's just to early to consider long-term effects. ,
Its so true,
Happy Labor Day!,
I agree I think its a bit unfair as well ,
Definitely an interesting read,
I agree ,
Wow. That's something I hadn't read before. As if they weren't bad enough on their own. Now the cancer-causing weed killer is involved. Respect yourselves. No GMOs.,
At least now I have a collection of masks to wear when the air becomes unbreathable.,
"If you fail cocid regulations and continue to be a threat in society, you should be faced with the death penalty.",
"link please.
",
"Trump wouldn't go for 1000 dead. He's more of a ""1,000,000 dead"" kinda guy. He likes those big impressive numbers.",
Tanks but no tanks.,
"Make everyone have health insurance, premiums go up and now some people won't be able to afford. Problem will keep continuing until something else happens. ",
Only if we have WEAK leaders!,
that is true we put all this money into everything and we see nothing in return,
"I don't trust anyone who calls people ""comrades""!",
Just cutting some fat and getting rid unnecessary regulations that make life difficult for business owners.,
do not see why we do not listen to gates more he has warn us but we just don't listen ,
I'm sure she really saw somebody say that. thatHappened,
"Big business, military, secret stuff, anywhere but where it's needed.",
I guess if yield is all you care about....,
enough to help others and help ourselves without any of the historical associations of inciting wars and orchestrating coups,
"biden understands global engagement without blowing everything up unlike trump so if people want to avoid war, avoid trump ",
Makes perfect sense to charge this outrageous amount of money for an antibody test because we are over reacting to the pandemic in the first place. ,

this seems great and seems like a good food forward,
It's so true. Today's generation wants to see things NOW but it'll take years or even decades to see the real cost and by that time it will be too late.,
that is true we have to think of the future,
I totally agree with this sentiment!,
I fear for the future generation. It's all going downhill...,
"Funny piece of art, not so funny real life situation. What the heck are we doing?!",
"Sure the environment is important, but is the economy not? Let's focus on the real issues first, such as our economy before we look at other minor issues.",
Why would the terrorists need to do anything when we're already killing our own citizens? Just some food for thought.,
word. not sure how people find anything up for debate given the stark numerical data clearly showing the massive failure of covid management in this country,

"Really, really heartbreaking. Our healthcare system is corrupt.",
It is unfathomable that we have a president who simply doesn't care!,
"They are a smaller country so it's definitely easier to contain the spread and track whoever got infected. That said, we still need to do better.",
trump's pocket?,
"I'm okay with wind and solar, but not so sure about nuclear....",
Each state doing its own thing isn't helping either. Meanwhile our president and his administration are just playing golf. ,
I would say no thanks to Trump. Other countries despise us now.,
"Trump is actively chipping away at environmental regulations, which will make Americans more unhealthy than they already are.",
I also agree. Better safe than sorry.,
"Wow. Hard to believe. But also, sadly, not.",
"Yes, others were able to control the virus. Bush and Obama knew this was a possibility. Trump chose to ignore it.",
I definitely think climate change has something to do with the wildfires.,
Is this really true? Katie Porter got the head of the CDC to say anyone could be tested for free. I guess he lied.,
"Many GMO crops are actually lacking in important micronutrients like manganese, as well as zinc and iron, in comparison with non GMO crops.",
that is alot and silly how people have to suffer with it,
"I don't think it's hysteria, it'sjust recognizing the fact that the pandemic has had a huge impact and will continue to affect us for quite some time.",
this is so true!!!,
the dow will drop by at least 20% by february guaranteed,
this is why we need a smaller government!!! The government also keeps pumping the stock market which will lead to a crash!,
We should be involved in global affairs and help other countries out. The better the world is the better the us is!!!,
we need to be more active in global affairs so this doesn't happen!,
"Exactly how it is, too many people needlessly died and are still dying due to the failure of our government. #FAILED. ",
It is already too late. Mountains of the dead.,
"Yeah, things really aren't getting great right now. Flat or down probably.",
No this carries through to other sources. Check it if you don't believe me.,
"""Report says""... wow what a source, it must be true...if ""report"" says.",
"I'm worried about the heat today. Power is shut off nearby. They are worried about wind sparking more downed power lines. Fire, oh my. Let's stop global warming now.",
Wow that's tough. You make a good point about Medicare or being able to buy in.,
"Agree, environment is important. So worried about fires/etc.",
"while I do agree with the Sentiment, after this weekend and Trump's awful behavior toward veterans and being caught in demoralizing lies, I'm tending on thinking I won't vote for him, no matter what.",
I'm ready to get on the Biden Bandwagon. So sick of Trump.,
"That's harsh, I'm in a similar environ. here. Warnings on today. power might go off here soon. ",
"Interesting post. While I am not really religious I do believe in acting morally, or being kind. This seems to fit that.",
"After today and yesterday, hearing from Veterans, talking to friends about Trump and his venom toward military, calling us losers, etc. I'm sick of it. I get it now.",
"I'm tending to start to change my mind. I'm NOT on the Trump Train any more. worried about our security and afraid a big Terror Attack might happen, maybe from within.",
Green tech could answer a lot of our problems. Maybe just using a bunch of solar? Using wind? Harnessing the waves.,
This is getting serious. I'm starting to worry about what damage Trump is really doing. Let's look closely at this.,
"This link is perfect. Thanks, it answers questions about what to do and how the Medicare addition will help everyone.",
This is a good point and one that is important to me. It gives a new way for thinking about worrying about the environment before redoing the economy.,
"Willie, you have a good point. I'm starting to see things your way.",
beliefs that are not at least partially based on data and facts are unreliable. a dhs report released a few days ago notes a very high risk of terrorism predominantly from far right terrorists,
"the odds are high. especially the odds of a white supremacist/domestic terror attack, unfortunately. that's according to a dhs report released a few days ago. ",

good read. most trump donors are pissed see sheldon adelson b/c trump's intentional malpractice and mismanagement cost them millions and billions of $,
