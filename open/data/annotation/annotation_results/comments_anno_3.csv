3,51,"Nuclear energy, with proper safety in place, is one the cleanest and most efficient forms of energy there is. ",1,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,52,"but it creates nuclear waste,has major accidents,causing a risk of cancer,and the cost of nuclear energy is higher than others in comparrison.",,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,53,"I do not think the government has went to far.They are simply asking people to wear a mask, out of respect of others.",1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
3,54,while I can see that as being a global citizen I think its best we keep out since we have our own problems,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,55,it can happen again and can be deadlier due to technology,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,56,"What about school closings, closed restaurants and other businesses? The economy is suffering, open the country!",,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
3,57,I completely agree! It's not right!,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,58,"He won't, its up to us to take care of ourselves.",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,59,"Global problems are our problems: trade, world poverty, famine, immigration...",,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,60,I think the government waited too long to do anything. Lockdown and restricting groups should have happened almost immediately. SARS was a warning no one heeded along with the MERS virus. ,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
3,65,"Security may be tighter, but we still get attacks, just on a smaller scale.",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,66,"Couldn't agree more. Nature heals, but economic slowdowns and recessions inflict pain and suffering. ",,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,
3,67,Its good to have our input on such matters. We can learn from others and they can learn from us.,,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,68,California is leading the way: https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2020/08/17/california-proposes-168-income-tax-rate-plus-4-wealth-tax/,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,
3,69,"Not sure we are fully secure here. Technology constantly changes and with that change come new exploits not caught. Those exploits will make us vulnerable. Homeland security is relatively a new entity created out of 911, although not a fail proof entity.",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,70,"I feel like we are moving away from nuclear energy, but at much too slow a pace.",,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,71,"But nothing like 911, certainly not over 1000 deaths.",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,72,Agreed!,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,74,Campaign reelection promise: no more Covid! Vaccine by Nov 3.,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,76,Nature will only heal if we leave it alone to do it's thing... If we keep destroying it and building on it it's not going to get a chance to heal. Economic growth needs to be able to work without destroying the planet.,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,
3,77,"My net worth is so far removed from 50 million, the issue seems almost farcical. As if it's a beyond-first-world-problems. And would be a comment only the one per-center's get.",1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,
3,78,"Open the country to keep the Dow alive. 30,000 by Nov 3",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,79,"It makes sense, nature will still be around once we're gone, but we need to get by as well, and for that we need an economy.",,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,
3,82,You are violating the rights of others by not wearing a mask.,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,84,"""Keep your friend's close, and your enemies closer."" Knowing what the other side of the globe is doing is important. The U.S. doesn't want any nasty surprises.",,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,87,"The government didn't act quick enough....If there had been a quicker response we wouldn't be looking at a death toll of over 180000
",1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
3,88,I agree,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,89,"Oil is dead, solar/wind is inefficient. Nuclear is one of the few remaining options. ",1,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,90,A few buzz words from the past: Chernobyl. Fukushima. Forgetting history means we are doomed to repeat those mistakes. ,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,91,Can you elaborate?,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,92,I wouldn't touch them...,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,93,Can't say I'm surprised.,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,94,The people making over 50 million dollars in this country are creating jobs for others and overall are contributing much more to society than they are taking away. This tax would be ridiculous and unfair.,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,
3,95,"I disagree. There are more security measures in place, but we are far from secure. There are so many ways that terrorists can threaten and kill us. foreign and American terrorists.",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,97,What sort of world affairs are you referring to?,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,98,opening the country would help out small businesses and not the big blue chip industries so i believe it would be going down. ,,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
3,99,Still makes me nervous,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,100,But why is it a bad idea?  Sounds pretty good to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,103,lol.  Absolutely!,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,104,I don't necessarily agree.,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,105,Interesting...  I don't know though,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,106,I think that the Dow Jones's performance will be greatly affected by the results of the election later this year. I do not think that it will drop if Joe Biden is elected because people will be hopeful and willing to invest.,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,107,"Also, I believe that even if Donald Trump were reelected, that would give people a sense of stability, which would also encourage them to invest in the economy.",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,108,I tend to agree with you,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,110,"agree with you 100% nuclear power is damaging in the long run. 
#environment #cleanenergy",,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,111,"This is one example why it is so important for the U.S. to take an active role in world affairs:
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-declines-join-global-covid-19-vaccine-effort/story?id=72770704",,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,112,We need to cooperate with other countries so that we can share in the important medical advances that they make. We can't afford to be left behind when we should be moving as fast as possible.,,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,113,agreed.,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,114,IF Joe biden is elected... There is a very good chance he will not get elected. Even if he does He wouldn't take office until after the year is over so I don't think anyone will be clamoring to invest before that.,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,116,Jack has it right.,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,117,It makes absolutely no sense to try to withdraw from world affairs when the world is becoming more connected than ever.,,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,118,yup.  agreed,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,119,"If we cut ourselves off and isolate from the world, we will regret it when we need help in the future.",,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,120,AGREED! What difference does is make if our economy is good right now when we are killing the planet for our kids and grandkids.,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,
3,121,i don't know if i would equate a trump victory with stability. I think it will further divide the country and the dow will reflect that.,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,122,"YES!!! Give people the option. 
#medicareforallwhowantit",1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,
3,123,true.  thanks to trump.  sigh.  need to vote him out of office!,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,124,Waiting for Trump to help us? That's gonna be a long wait. ,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,125,Taxing people who make millions of dollars at high amounts just creates a disincentive to working harder and making more money. It stifles innovation and entrepreneurship.,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,
3,126,you don't agree that the environment is suffering? ,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,
3,127,"I disagree as I believe that Congress will pass more legislation enabling more rounds of stimulus checks sometime this year, and that will encourage people to invest.",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,128,"While I don't think we should be turning a blind eye to world affairs, I would like to see us concentrate on us for once! Let's repair America!",1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,129,I do not understand why a wealth tax is needed since the marginal income tax rate is already so high.,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,
3,131,"@Kathryn_3504  People who make 50 million dollars do not get to take home 50 million dollars at the end of the day. The real amount of much, much less.",,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,
3,132,"Yes, nature has been around forever and will continue to be around forever. But the state of nature will probably not be one that is hospitable to human life eventually if we keep neglecting and abusing it! #earthfirst",1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,
3,134,"Upon further examination, I believe the U.S., WHO, and the CDC have over reacted with safety measures. Our chances of catching COVID-19 is only 1 percent. Let's open up the country now!",,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
3,136,The U.S. government has gone too far??? What? They haven't gone far enough! The number of Covid deaths and infections in our country is a travesty.,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
3,137,"yes, even though I think it is likely we could see another attack as bad...even an attack half as bad would be devastating and very likely.",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,138,"I'm on your side. If we don't protect the environment, the environment won't protect us. We need to think long term here!",1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,
3,139,interesting read! thanks for posting.,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,140,"yes, how many things have sounded great and then later we find out how harmful they are. weed killer sounded great. Plastic sounded great. let's really investigate and think this through before we consume it.",,,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,141,Why are you saying it is bad idea? What backs that up?,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,142,Thank you Allison! If we don't protect mother Earth it doesn't matter how the economy does because we are going to spend countless billions or trillions trying to fix the damage global warming is doing.,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,
3,143,Thanks Allison! By being so myopic we are opening ourselves up to other threats. We need to be vigilant!,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,144,"It just makes sense to me that the more you make, the more you have to pay in taxes. Isn't that how it works for us ""little folk?"" I'm not trying to take advantage of the rich, but I think they can give a little more. ",1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,
3,145,"And how many rich are paying little or no taxes due to being able to take advantage of loopholes and such. I'm looking at you, Trump!",1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,
3,146,I wish it was possible to view a different reality where we had different leadership...To see what the response and outcome of the pandemic would have been.,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
3,147,agreed. so many are lulled into a false sense of security.,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,148,"The ""tax cuts"" unfortunately were skewed towards corporations and the wealthy. Even Warren Buffet said he was surprised how little taxes he pays.",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,149,"thanks. I know there are many problems in the world and we need to help, but I just want to concentrate on America for a while.",1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,150,These CEO's that are making outrageous salaries and getting insane bonuses at the expensive of the little people... I think it makes sense for them to give a little more back (in taxes).,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,
3,154,"Yeah, what Alison_5893 said.",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,156,Yeah.  Wish it wasn't true but that's the way it is.,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,157,Where's the money gonna come from?,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,158,Could not agree more. I don't know why people are so against this.  Access to health care is a basic human need/right.,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,
3,159,I agree we need to save the earth now! Economic growth will catch up later,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,
3,160,Why can't we build an economy that doesn't destroy the planet? If the planet goes we all go... We need to live to even have an economy to worry about!,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,
3,161,I think it's going to be 20% lower at least by the end of the year. I don't think the country is going to keep giving it up to the big blue chip companies if things keep being handled the same way.,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,162,i agree that we need to focus on us most!,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,164,"i think that going to classes should be fine,you can still take the virus seriously and still live life",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,166,"@kathryn_3504, would you be so concerned about the economy if you had a loved one pass away suddenly? Lives come first.",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,167,I completely agree with you. No amount of economic growth is worth risking the health of our planet!,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,
3,169,"Eight million people are killed by tobacco each year, but no one is lo that concerned about that.",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,175,"I don't like wearing a mask either, but it is vital that we do out of respect for others. ",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,176,"I agree that the government has not done enough, on the federal level and state level. ",1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
3,177,I'm with you on this one. We have no idea how GMO affects us long term as there is not enough data. I want nothing to do with it!,,,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,178,Makes me nervous as well. This is something that the government should not cut funding for and should put extra effort into new technology to help keep this country safe. ,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,179,"I have to agree with you.  With everything going on, I wouldn't be surprised if it did worse than that.",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,182,People who smoke do it to themselves though so that is not a fair comparison.,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,188,I can't prove it!,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,189,I should not have to wear a mask.  Why is it my responsibility to worry about others? They don't care about me.,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,190,"I think for right now we should stay neutral. Maybe if a new leader takes office in November we could be more effective overseas, but at this point it's best to lay low.",1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,192,People are out of control. The government needs to do more to enforce the laws so that we can all stay safe!,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,193,I should not have to wear a mask.  Why is it my responsibility to worry about others? They don't care about me. ,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,195,I like the hashtag -- freakyfoods. lol,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,196,I think that it is true since there is just too much to keep up with right now,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,197,It boggles my mind how irresponsible people are. They need to do more to get things under control.,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
3,203,People are out of control. The government needs to do more to enforce the laws so that we can all stay safe!,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
3,204,I would also want the option to choose. Let the people decide!,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,205,I couldn't agree more. How can we possibly help anyone else when we can't get our own act together?,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,206,"So true. The ecosystem is a delicate balance. Without the animals, we are all screwed!",1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,
3,207,I agree Alison. Before COVID I held the opposite opinion but we need to focus on what is best for our country to get back on track.,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,208,They definitely are not doing enough. Look at the mass gatherings taking place all over the country. People think this whole thing is a joke!,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
3,209,It isn't worth the damage we will cause the planet. What good is growth when the planet you live on is ruined?,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,
3,210,Things are not looking good. Hoping things will turn around but I won't hold my breath.,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,211,I know someone who child went back to school and they shut down after 2 days. I don't understand this need to rush. It is inconvenient but contracting the virus is so much worse.,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,212,The rich can afford to pay extra. 2% is a drop in the bucket compared to what they have.,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,
3,213,I agree. There are safe ways to reopen. ,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,214,It's important that we start to level the playing field a little. ,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,
3,215,Scary!,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,216,"With all the distractions, it is easy to become complacent. We need to keep our guard up.",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,217,Definitely not enough study done to know its true effects. Better to avoid!,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,218,I agree lets get USA in order first!,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,219,"Oh no. I didn't realize that graphic would be so big! Well, at least it gets my point across? :)
#proudAmerican",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,220,I agree lets get USA in order first,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,221,It seems common sense. I'm surprised how many people in society don't agree with it. ,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,222,Interesting how the Covid-19 lockdown has given us cleaner skies and lower greenhouse emissions!,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,223,"This picture brings back so much emotion. I agree, we cannot lose focus or get complacent. ",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,224,Yes! Even some billionaires support this tax to improve the economy.,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,
3,225,"Yeah, to all those who want to fix the world, let me just say that we will be able to do that so much better if we deal with our own issues first.  Also a #proudAmerican",1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,226,Both are important for the future of our children and their children and on down the line. Build the economy by encouraging businesses to be sustainable and invest in new areas that can help reduce the carbon imprint. ,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,
3,227,Stay safe and educate,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,228,We can encourage businesses to invest in way to protect the environment. That way we are helping the economy and the environment.,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,
3,229,"Once these GMO's are in our environment that can not be recalled, scary",,,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,230,Me neither. It's better to be cautious.,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,231,"We do have a lot of issues to deal with, but I think we a great enough country to do more than one thing at once. ",,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,232,"I agree, but it it doesn't have to be just one thing.  The Green New Deal has show that by helping the environment we can grow the economy at the same time, it's a win-win. ",1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,
3,233,"I couldn't agree more.  It you had a $1, who wouldn't give two pennies of it to help someone else out?   It's such a small price to pay. ",1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,
3,234,I think this whole deep-seat racism argument is bunk.  This isn't the 1950s... we just had a black president and we have another black VP candidate. ,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,235,"That's whack.  People have been eating GMOs for decades, ain't crowds of people dying.  You know who would be dying without GMOs? All the people who have been saved by drought resistant GMO wheat and other crops.",1,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,236,"You got that right.  But how will people follow the governments rules when the speaker of the house is sneaking out to a closed salon to get a blowout, not wearing a mask?",1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
3,237,GMO foods use less pesticides to grow and are not as harmful to the environment as conventially-grown foods.,1,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,238,"Do you have a link for that, I think it's good to be cautious but I like to see the research instead of just reacting, kwim?
",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,239,"Do you have a link for that, I think it's good to be cautious but I like to see the research instead of just reacting, kwim?",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,240,"I am terrified at the number of people that would be dead, if it weren't for GMO crops.  They thought we would run out of food when the earth hit 4 billion people, but thanks to GMO crops we are safely double that. ",1,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,241,Right on!  #taxthewealthy,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,
3,242,"You got some proof to back that up? GMOs have saved millions for starving and greatly reduced pesticide use, which is makes them far more safe than non GMO.  ",1,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,243,"Yeah, crazy.  I wish people would do better and I wish the government would do better.",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,244,"Yeah, crazy.  
**I wish people would do better and I wish the government would do better.**",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,245,That‚Äôs crazy! I thought all insurance had to cover COVID 100%?,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,246,"oops. sorry about the double post. I **really, really* wish.  Lol.",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,247,My 401k is loving it. ,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,248,Mine too!,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,249,Genetic manipulation of the seed does not affect quality of plant or fruit. Totally safe!,1,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,250,"Wow, wind turbines!",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,251,A happy medium would be nice. Balance safety and economic recovery,,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
3,252,A happy medium would be nice. Balance safety and economic recovery.,,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
3,253,That is scary!,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,254,We are still in a recession! ,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,255,"Yes, tax!",1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,
3,256,Health vs economy! Of course numbers go up when testing goes up. ,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,257,Yes but the efficiency and capacity is not there. ,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,258,"Yes, and dealing with #climatechange should be first on the list! Economic growth is not an excuse for delay!",1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,
3,259,"Yes, and dealing with climate change should be first on the list! Economic growth is not an excuse for delay!",1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,
3,260,"How convenient virus comes on an election year, thank you China",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,261,How do you propose we pay for universal health care? More taxes on struggling Americans?,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,262,that is good even if you do not like it but keep others safe i nice!,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,263,So true,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,264,"It will yoyo with the upcoming election, but 30,000 year end, if  not before. Regardless of who is elected. ",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,265,"Also, most existing nuclear power reactors are widely regarded as obsolete.",,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,266,We do need to clean up our house first!,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,267,Interesting article,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,268,"I agree, this virus is killing our economy",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,269,"Agree, taking away our freedom",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,270,Thank you China,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,271,closed lower today but shares of major tech companies rose ahead of earnings,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,272,"Yes especially jobs right now, reopen America!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,273,So much better on the environment too,,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
3,274,You only need to look at all the food products that are organic and non GMO verified to be aware that GMO's are harmful to everyone.,,,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,275,I think I would not mind if I had over 50M,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,
3,276,"Yes, peace for the world",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,277,Just what we need right now!,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,278,All great alternatives!,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,279,I think it's best to avoid GMO's. Unfortunately there are no federal mandates to label food items that contain GMO's. The best option to avoid them is to purchase organic and non GMO verified products.,,,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,280,"Four years of America first has damaged global relations and cooperation. Come on America, be a team player!",,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,281,Would closing our borders keep us safe?,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,282,"I agree, over response. Herd immunity is the key! Look at other countries and how they have remained open, while not sacrificing the economy. ",,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
3,283,Where did the 90% accuracy come from? I would love to see the statistical analysis and prediction methods. ,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,284,I totally agree with you. We are responsible for the animals.,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,285,Jamal there are so many loopholes. They made her take a flu test before a covid test and charged $700 just for that.,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,286,Ever since I watched the Chernobyl miniseries I've been acutely aware of what could go wrong. I'd be VERY uncomfortable having a nuclear plant near where I live.,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,287,"Interesting article, but simply be moderate and play it safe. We need to enjoy our lives and live free. ",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,288,I really don't see the economy improving long-term without more stimulus.,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
3,289,"I would support it above a certain threshold. For example Jeff Bezos has two billion dollars. We could tax him HEAVILY and he would never miss it, and that money could go a long way to help people who have been hurt by lockdown.",1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,
3,290,I agree with Luke. I don't see much economic recovery happening unless things drastically turn around fast.,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,291,I definitely don't hate this option but would really prefer for everyone to have access to healthcare at no cost. It's a human right. ,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,
3,292,What good would a wealth tax on the very few do for our overall economy and national debt?,,1,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,
3,293,"I absolutely hate wearing the mask, it fogs up my glasses. But I believe in doing my part to keep people safe. I just hope we don't have to do it forever.",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,294,That is awful. I am all for universal healthcare. I don't know how it will ever happen though. Both sides seemed to never be able to agree. ,,,1,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,
3,295,Besos and Gates have more than they can ever spend. We could tax them hard and they'd never miss it. It's disgusting to me that just a few individuals control so much of this country's wealth.,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,
3,296,"I think so too. I heard yesterday that the market recovery we have seen is based on the expectation of more stimulus, and that stimulus is nowhere in sight.",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,297,"They should start handing out tickets and fines in my opinion, and when this happens on campuses they need to expel people.",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,298,"Higher taxes may negatively affect the Dow, however. Money spent on taxes cannot be invested in businesses.",,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,
3,299,I don't know. I don't see why it should be America's place to be the world's nanny or the world's police. We need to take care of our own people. Put the oxygen mask on ourselves before we help others.,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3,905,Are you saying we need to ignore world affairs? That's part of the reason why America is in this mess. We didn't listen to the rest of the world.,,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,906,"Agree, nuclear energy is not worth the risk.",,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,907,I would argue that security will be even tighter leading up to the November election and limitations of movement during the current pandemic. ,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,908,I would certainly believe that this is possible. I think that would be the case with any frontline profession - not just law enforcement. It is staggering to think that the number could exceed the 9/11 law enforcement deaths.,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,909,That's the state government. Florida has always been shady and sinister in their dealings with state and country. The state's citizens need to vote them out. But I think the Federal Government has gone way overboard on the COVID restrictions. ,,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,

3,916,Great tip! xD,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,917,We should be able to prioritize both!,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,918,This is sad :( rather than face the truth they'd rather cover it up and act like everything is fine. ,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,919,Yes there should be a way where we can all meet in the middle and allow people the freedom to buy in if they so chooses without people such as yourself losing your insurance.,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,

3,926,This is scary to think about..but more search needs to be done.,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,927,We have enough resources and ability to help other nations. We all share the same Earth and it's our responsibility to look out for our global brothers and sisters.,,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,928,Jamal_4473 Thanks for backing me up! The list could go on for days.,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,929,"I'm with you man, we need to prioritize the economy. Though I wouldn't say to neglect the environment at all, it's just on a lower scale of priority for me.",,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,
3,930,Smh ,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,931,I kinda agree but I feel like other factors are involved as well,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,932,:( our government needs to step up ,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,933,Ha! That's hilarious. And not a surprise at all. Score 1 for the environment!,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,934,We can do both! Just don't panic. The DOW has already regained a lot of its momentum and will continue to. Have faith in the DOW and start being kinder to Mother Earth.,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,
3,935,"""they"" are expensive to make? Who are they? ",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,936,"Yes, just saying it will magically go away hasn't worked. Who would have imagined it. We were supposed to all get a chocolate Easter Bunny, not Covid...at least that's what the great Orange one said. You're right on this.",1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,

3,938,Oh great...we need to step up and protect our borders. Where's all our tax dollars going?,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,939,I agree we need to take care of what we live in and we need to think long term not short.,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,940,I agree I mean how you seen how much trash we make each year on just products alone,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,941,I do not know why they would not follow or at least see the last presidents suggestion that they can do better? they had 8 years worth of information and guidelines but threw it out due to party affiliation.,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
3,942,that is true I can makefunny faces to myself without feeling weird about it!~,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,943,there is always a worry but we do not know until it happens it can go down or even up.,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,944,while we should take care of the economy we also need to take care of the environment and stop choosing provide over care of nature,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,
3,945,Don't think so. It's already recouped most of what it lost. Will it be down? Probably. By 20%? Nah.,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,946,We've already had the crash. We are in the recouping phase.,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,947,i think there is but I think that it should be lower if you are in private insurance so you do not pay so much,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,
3,948,HAHAHAHA.  serves them right,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,949,We are living on borrowed time. Pretty soon there won't be any sand left for the White House to bury their heads in.,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,950,so how do you suggest reconciling protecting the environment with economic interests?  Because that's important as well.,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,
3,951,"seriously, why do people not understand this is about life and death!!",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,952,remembering this when I go back to work on Tuesday!,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,953,Actually I think they needed to do LESS and instead focused MORE on getting a vaccine and heeding all the early warnings. #COVIDiots-In-Charge,,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
3,954,"nice point, I agree.",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,955,This is actually not something I have considered before.,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,

3,957,"very informative and I like how they break it down using the different icons ,makes it easy to read and understand",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,958,It's ridiculous!!  It really is.,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,959,I catch myself making weird faces all the time. I'm starting to wonder if I did that before without the mask and if I didn't I probably will when the time comes. ,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,960,pretty awful isn't it.,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,961,"yup, probably not the greatest thing to be eating",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,962,interesting!,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,963,"scary.  yeah I agree, not going away any time soon.",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,964,I don't know...  Someone will likely come up with something.  But it's a little nerve wracking that because they are in such a hurry to develop it may not be entirely safe.  Chances are it will be expensive and not available to all as well...,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,965,"not surprised, but yikes!",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,966,"the health care system in America is broken,and we need to try something new because health care shouldn't be so much people pay over 400 a month just on insurance alone where most of that money could go towards their other bills",1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,

3,971,Why didn't America try to work with other countries to solve COVID19? This was not the time to go it alone.,,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,972,"i do think we need to work with others,it has to be a group effort because we are all human",,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,973,i think people are viewing china negative and I do not see how they are a  leader with how they handle their people,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,974,Which begs the question: what do they do all day?,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,975,I think they've been doing a good job. The sooner we get to herd immunity the better. No need for restrictions.,,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
3,976,this is a great look with how organized it looks and the colors really draw you in,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,977,"If Medicare was available to all, the system would be forced to fix itself. As it is, medical care is unaffordable and there needs to be an option that allows anyone to apply for medicare if they do not wish to keep their private insurace. ",1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,

3,983,"We may never know, Luke.",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,984,This is why the government needs to calm down over restrictions. The economy needs to get back up and running as fast as possible. ,,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
3,985,Aren't there already too many restrictions in the US? ,,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
3,986,Agree with you so much. The devastation to the economy has been enough.  We need to scale back on restrictions right now.,,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,

3,1118,"I agree with Diamond, probably won't be available to everyone, especially people without insurance. I anticipate long lines.",,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
3,1119,I think the opposite at this point. We need to focus on our homeland right now and pull ourselves together before we can help other countries. That's not to say shut them out completely but we have a lot of work to do here first.,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
