105,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,8,Interesting...  I don't know though
106,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,I think that the Dow Jones's performance will be greatly affected by the results of the election later this year. I do not think that it will drop if Joe Biden is elected because people will be hopeful and willing to invest.

114,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,IF Joe biden is elected... There is a very good chance he will not get elected. Even if he does He wouldn't take office until after the year is over so I don't think anyone will be clamoring to invest before that.
116,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,8,Jack has it right.
117,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,1,It makes absolutely no sense to try to withdraw from world affairs when the world is becoming more connected than ever.

125,0,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,2,3,Taxing people who make millions of dollars at high amounts just creates a disincentive to working harder and making more money. It stifles innovation and entrepreneurship.

142,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,Thank you Allison! If we don't protect mother Earth it doesn't matter how the economy does because we are going to spend countless billions or trillions trying to fix the damage global warming is doing.
143,0,0,0,0,5,8,8,8,0,8,Thanks Allison! By being so myopic we are opening ourselves up to other threats. We need to be vigilant!
144,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,3,"It just makes sense to me that the more you make, the more you have to pay in taxes. Isn't that how it works for us ""little folk?"" I'm not trying to take advantage of the rich, but I think they can give a little more. "
145,1,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,3,"And how many rich are paying little or no taxes due to being able to take advantage of loopholes and such. I'm looking at you, Trump!"
146,0,0,0,1,7,8,7,7,0,7,I wish it was possible to view a different reality where we had different leadership...To see what the response and outcome of the pandemic would have been.
147,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,agreed. so many are lulled into a false sense of security.
148,0,1,0,1,3,3,8,3,0,3,"The ""tax cuts"" unfortunately were skewed towards corporations and the wealthy. Even Warren Buffet said he was surprised how little taxes he pays."

156,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,8,Yeah.  Wish it wasn't true but that's the way it is.
157,0,0,0,1,8,8,8,4,0,8,Where's the money gonna come from?
158,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,8,0,4,Could not agree more. I don't know why people are so against this.  Access to health care is a basic human need/right.
159,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,5,0,5,I agree we need to save the earth now! Economic growth will catch up later
160,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,Why can't we build an economy that doesn't destroy the planet? If the planet goes we all go... We need to live to even have an economy to worry about!
161,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,I think it's going to be 20% lower at least by the end of the year. I don't think the country is going to keep giving it up to the big blue chip companies if things keep being handled the same way.
162,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,i agree that we need to focus on us most!
164,2,0,0,0,7,8,8,8,0,8,"i think that going to classes should be fine,you can still take the virus seriously and still live life"
166,0,0,0,0,7,8,8,8,0,8,"@kathryn_3504, would you be so concerned about the economy if you had a loved one pass away suddenly? Lives come first."
167,2,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,I completely agree with you. No amount of economic growth is worth risking the health of our planet!
169,2,0,0,0,7,8,8,8,0,8,"Eight million people are killed by tobacco each year, but no one is lo that concerned about that."

176,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,0,7,"I agree that the government has not done enough, on the federal level and state level. "
177,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,I'm with you on this one. We have no idea how GMO affects us long term as there is not enough data. I want nothing to do with it!
178,0,2,0,0,7,0,8,8,0,8,Makes me nervous as well. This is something that the government should not cut funding for and should put extra effort into new technology to help keep this country safe. 
179,0,0,0,0,7,8,8,0,0,8,"I have to agree with you.  With everything going on, I wouldn't be surprised if it did worse than that."
182,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,People who smoke do it to themselves though so that is not a fair comparison.
188,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,8,I can't prove it!
189,2,0,0,2,7,8,8,7,0,7,I should not have to wear a mask.  Why is it my responsibility to worry about others? They don't care about me.
190,0,0,0,1,8,1,1,1,0,1,"I think for right now we should stay neutral. Maybe if a new leader takes office in November we could be more effective overseas, but at this point it's best to lay low."
192,0,0,0,0,7,7,8,7,0,7,People are out of control. The government needs to do more to enforce the laws so that we can all stay safe!
193,2,0,0,2,7,8,8,7,0,7,I should not have to wear a mask.  Why is it my responsibility to worry about others? They don't care about me. 
195,2,0,0,0,2,8,8,8,0,8,I like the hashtag -- freakyfoods. lol
196,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,8,I think that it is true since there is just too much to keep up with right now
197,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,0,7,It boggles my mind how irresponsible people are. They need to do more to get things under control.
203,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,0,7,People are out of control. The government needs to do more to enforce the laws so that we can all stay safe!
204,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,I would also want the option to choose. Let the people decide!
205,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,I couldn't agree more. How can we possibly help anyone else when we can't get our own act together?
206,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,"So true. The ecosystem is a delicate balance. Without the animals, we are all screwed!"
207,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,I agree Alison. Before COVID I held the opposite opinion but we need to focus on what is best for our country to get back on track.
208,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,0,7,They definitely are not doing enough. Look at the mass gatherings taking place all over the country. People think this whole thing is a joke!
209,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,It isn't worth the damage we will cause the planet. What good is growth when the planet you live on is ruined?
210,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,Things are not looking good. Hoping things will turn around but I won't hold my breath.
211,0,0,0,0,7,8,8,8,0,8,I know someone who child went back to school and they shut down after 2 days. I don't understand this need to rush. It is inconvenient but contracting the virus is so much worse.
212,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,3,The rich can afford to pay extra. 2% is a drop in the bucket compared to what they have.
213,2,0,0,2,7,8,8,7,0,7,I agree. There are safe ways to reopen. 
214,0,0,0,0,3,8,3,3,0,3,It's important that we start to level the playing field a little.

221,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,8,It seems common sense. I'm surprised how many people in society don't agree with it. 
222,0,0,0,0,7,8,8,5,0,8,Interesting how the Covid-19 lockdown has given us cleaner skies and lower greenhouse emissions!
223,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,0,8,"This picture brings back so much emotion. I agree, we cannot lose focus or get complacent. "
224,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,3,Yes! Even some billionaires support this tax to improve the economy.

232,0,0,0,1,5,8,5,5,0,5,"I agree, but it it doesn't have to be just one thing.  The Green New Deal has show that by helping the environment we can grow the economy at the same time, it's a win-win. "
233,0,0,0,0,3,8,3,3,0,3,"I couldn't agree more.  It you had a $1, who wouldn't give two pennies of it to help someone else out?   It's such a small price to pay. "
234,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,8,0,8,I think this whole deep-seat racism argument is bunk.  This isn't the 1950s... we just had a black president and we have another black VP candidate. 
235,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,0,2,"That's whack.  People have been eating GMOs for decades, ain't crowds of people dying.  You know who would be dying without GMOs? All the people who have been saved by drought resistant GMO wheat and other crops."
236,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,8,0,7,"You got that right.  But how will people follow the governments rules when the speaker of the house is sneaking out to a closed salon to get a blowout, not wearing a mask?"
237,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,0,2,GMO foods use less pesticides to grow and are not as harmful to the environment as conventially-grown foods.
