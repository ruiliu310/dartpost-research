68	California is leading the way: https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2020/08/17/california-proposes-168-income-tax-rate-plus-4-wealth-tax/	2020-09-03 02:52:38.45+00	2020-09-03 02:52:38.459+00	97	2593
69	Not sure we are fully secure here. Technology constantly changes and with that change come new exploits not caught. Those exploits will make us vulnerable. Homeland security is relatively a new entity created out of 911, although not a fail proof entity.	2020-09-03 02:54:01.828+00	2020-09-03 02:54:01.84+00	94	2719
79	It makes sense, nature will still be around once we're gone, but we need to get by as well, and for that we need an economy.	2020-09-03 03:04:48.007+00	2020-09-03 03:04:48.02+00	105	2679
70	I feel like we are moving away from nuclear energy, but at much too slow a pace.	2020-09-03 02:54:27.349+00	2020-09-03 02:54:27.362+00	93	2679
51	Nuclear energy, with proper safety in place, is one the cleanest and most efficient forms of energy there is. 	2020-09-03 02:19:56.218+00	2020-09-03 02:19:56.226+00	93	2593
52	but it creates nuclear waste,has major accidents,causing a risk of cancer,and the cost of nuclear energy is higher than others in comparrison.	2020-09-03 02:41:38.743+00	2020-09-03 02:41:38.751+00	93	2580
53	I do not think the government has went to far.They are simply asking people to wear a mask, out of respect of others.	2020-09-03 02:42:26.089+00	2020-09-03 02:42:26.097+00	98	2580

60	I think the government waited too long to do anything. Lockdown and restricting groups should have happened almost immediately. SARS was a warning no one heeded along with the MERS virus. 	2020-09-03 02:48:32.667+00	2020-09-03 02:48:32.677+00	98	2719

76	Nature will only heal if we leave it alone to do it's thing... If we keep destroying it and building on it it's not going to get a chance to heal. Economic growth needs to be able to work without destroying the planet.	2020-09-03 02:57:25.812+00	2020-09-03 02:57:25.821+00	99	2657

279	I think it's best to avoid GMO's. Unfortunately there are no federal mandates to label food items that contain GMO's. The best option to avoid them is to purchase organic and non GMO verified products.	2020-09-03 14:06:56.643+00	2020-09-03 14:06:56.66+00	123	2683

286	Ever since I watched the Chernobyl miniseries I've been acutely aware of what could go wrong. I'd be VERY uncomfortable having a nuclear plant near where I live.	2020-09-03 14:42:23.005+00	2020-09-03 14:42:23.021+00	93	2627

287	Interesting article, but simply be moderate and play it safe. We need to enjoy our lives and live free. 	2020-09-03 14:47:04.773+00	2020-09-03 14:47:05.883+00	143	2593

288	I really don't see the economy improving long-term without more stimulus.	2020-09-03 14:51:00.293+00	2020-09-03 14:51:00.303+00	125	2627
298	Higher taxes may negatively affect the Dow, however. Money spent on taxes cannot be invested in businesses.	2020-09-03 15:16:35.69+00	2020-09-03 15:16:36.552+00	152	2691
289	I would support it above a certain threshold. For example Jeff Bezos has two billion dollars. We could tax him HEAVILY and he would never miss it, and that money could go a long way to help people who have been hurt by lockdown.	2020-09-03 14:53:01.965+00	2020-09-03 14:53:01.975+00	103	2627
294	That is awful. I am all for universal healthcare. I don't know how it will ever happen though. Both sides seemed to never be able to agree. 	2020-09-03 14:57:27.396+00	2020-09-03 14:57:51.009+00	150	2750
295	Besos and Gates have more than they can ever spend. We could tax them hard and they'd never miss it. It's disgusting to me that just a few individuals control so much of this country's wealth.	2020-09-03 15:04:20.291+00	2020-09-03 15:04:20.301+00	129	2627
303	I completely agree. Just one example is the homeless situation in this country. It seems very unethical and immoral to me to extend aid to other countries when we have so many American citizens struggling and in need. 	2020-09-03 15:34:49.123+00	2020-09-03 15:34:50.228+00	111	2627
296	I think so too. I heard yesterday that the market recovery we have seen is based on the expectation of more stimulus, and that stimulus is nowhere in sight.	2020-09-03 15:05:12.109+00	2020-09-03 15:05:12.13+00	130	2627
299	I don't know. I don't see why it should be America's place to be the world's nanny or the world's police. We need to take care of our own people. Put the oxygen mask on ourselves before we help others.	2020-09-03 15:22:10.917+00	2020-09-03 15:22:10.928+00	134	2627
300	They aren't doing ANYTHING. America's covid response is a joke. The rest of the world is laughing at us and rightly so. 	2020-09-03 15:23:25.243+00	2020-09-03 15:23:25.259+00	131	2627
301	I like this attitude! 	2020-09-03 15:25:15.349+00	2020-09-03 15:25:15.357+00	140	2627
302	They will never even miss it. They will never even notice it is gone. These people have an inconceivable amount of money. The wealth gap in this country is absolutely ridiculous.	2020-09-03 15:32:26.449+00	2020-09-03 15:32:29.074+00	97	2627
304	It is definitely a better for our future generation to aggressively participate in global affairs in order to create a better world for generations in the future.	2020-09-03 15:35:00.735+00	2020-09-03 15:35:00.744+00	177	2601
308	Solar and wind are where we need to invest, no more talks of nuclear energy. Let's get on board with harnessing the wind and sun! 	2020-09-03 16:23:21.236+00	2020-09-03 16:23:21.245+00	171	2603
306	Rich people always find ways to pay less taxes, no need to push them too far.	2020-09-03 15:41:36.554+00	2020-09-03 15:41:37.508+00	180	2601
307	I totally agree, we would look ridiculous trying to police another country or show ourselves as a model to follow when our cities are burning and our politicians are so divided that they are fighting like school children on the news.	2020-09-03 16:05:25.397+00	2020-09-03 16:05:27.268+00	172	2603
310	How much of this tax would even go to those who need it. A tax, just to tax, is not ncessary.	2020-09-03 16:50:41.956+00	2020-09-03 16:50:44.585+00	97	2593
309	Are you sure about that?  Respectfully, it is your job to say that international affairs are more important than domestic affairs.	2020-09-03 16:38:32.033+00	2020-09-03 16:38:38.292+00	167	2409
311	The economy and the environment need to be equal priorities. Saving the environment can lead to new industries, boosting the economy. We can do both!	2020-09-03 16:54:05.004+00	2020-09-03 16:54:05.013+00	119	2603

313	We'd look like hypocrites policing the world while some of our cities are burning and politicians are fighting like schoolchildren in the media. Enough is enough, it's time to take care of our own nation and stop worrying so much about other nations.	2020-09-03 17:25:50.862+00	2020-09-03 17:25:52.066+00	134	2603
314	The U.S. needs to take this virus seriously, we don't know enough about it in order to make informed decisions. Mask are a precaution, better to be safe than sorry. 	2020-09-03 17:56:13.726+00	2020-09-03 17:56:14.822+00	98	2701

316	We should not have to pay more at all. We already have the funding. The current system is incredibly inefficient with how it allocates wealth. With the new system, the efficiency will SAVE us money long term.	2020-09-03 18:05:37.661+00	2020-09-03 18:05:37.672+00	136	2687
317	Agreed, they make jobs and have a lot of wealth that is capital, not just money sitting around.	2020-09-03 18:06:57.238+00	2020-09-03 18:06:57.247+00	202	2687
318	We will save money from how efficient universal healthcare is. That way health care isn't dependent of someone's JOB which can change all the time. Or those without jobs aren't screwed like they are now.	2020-09-03 18:08:15.483+00	2020-09-03 18:08:15.49+00	150	2687
329	Exactly, Lucas, we pride ourselves on being the best in the world but we've failed miserably this time.  We need to do better, and I'm looking at our current president and his cohorts.	2020-09-03 18:54:01.087+00	2020-09-03 18:54:01.108+00	98	2544
319	Completely agree with everyone! Thanks for the comments!	2020-09-03 18:09:22.251+00	2020-09-03 18:09:31.19+00	115	2618
320	Here we are safe. Here, we are free. Welcome to the USA.	2020-09-03 18:09:50.807+00	2020-09-03 18:09:51.631+00	208	2687
338	Yup, but there are people starving now.	2020-09-03 19:12:03.766+00	2020-09-03 19:12:03.775+00	109	2601
321	I totally agree. Things will quickly change when people start getting fined for their behavior.	2020-09-03 18:10:10.213+00	2020-09-03 18:10:10.221+00	127	2702
330	Massive disorganization and mis-communications.  If the government expects people to do their part, the government needs to do its part. Guidelines have been unclear, not at all uniform, and poorly enforced.  180,000 dead is not a joke, people.	2020-09-03 18:55:59.757+00	2020-09-03 18:55:59.768+00	127	2544
322	Yeah, our focus right now is only on the current crisis. We have to plan better.	2020-09-03 18:10:37.322+00	2020-09-03 18:10:41.815+00	113	2618
323	It is very sad that there are people forcing kids to go back to school, even though we know for a fact that Covid cases are going up right now. We need to at least make students and teachers use online platforms again. 	2020-09-03 18:16:28.981+00	2020-09-03 18:16:31.305+00	102	2711
324	Disagree strongly. In order to fix our problems, we must be more involved globally. Understanding our issues requires global support. You can't fix climate change alone.	2020-09-03 18:41:58.821+00	2020-09-03 18:41:58.839+00	111	2610
331	Our economy is suffering massively due to this!	2020-09-03 18:58:48.366+00	2020-09-03 18:58:48.383+00	98	2658
325	America has over 190,000 deaths, the worst in the world. This is a failure of our health care system and the people in charge who ignored what was happening globally. Wearing a mask is the least we should do.	2020-09-03 18:44:14.715+00	2020-09-03 18:44:14.793+00	98	2610
326	Its will be affected by the presidential election, but if Trump gets reelected, He can fix our economy to what it was 2019. Polls show that he is in the margin of error. 	2020-09-03 18:46:09.485+00	2020-09-03 18:46:09.496+00	104	2711

327	Whats your favorite GMO? Mine is bananas with Corn being in 2nd.	2020-09-03 18:49:56.256+00	2020-09-03 18:49:56.273+00	107	2711
332	If the Corgi can wear a mask, then SO CAN I  	2020-09-03 19:00:22.299+00	2020-09-03 19:00:22.309+00	120	2711
328	There have actually been long term studies. Corn was the first GMO ever produced. You need to be a little more specific if you want labels because if you look at what corn originally looked like, you can say we have engineered them for the better. 	2020-09-03 18:52:24.844+00	2020-09-03 18:52:24.853+00	123	2711
339	It's hard to understand how we're the only one of wealthy countries that does NOT have some kind of universal health care and that we think that something is wrong it.  I simply can't comprehend why we can't do this.	2020-09-03 19:12:38.975+00	2020-09-03 19:12:38.985+00	150	2544

377	I can't fully agree with this one. We need to take care of ourselves first, but also put some resources into world affairs to keep our interest safe.	2020-09-03 20:39:28.757+00	2020-09-03 20:39:28.835+00	96	2588

853	I agree. Why should those who worked hard for their money be penalized 	2020-09-05 15:52:49.882+00	2020-09-05 15:52:49.898+00	713	2649
851	That graphic is always used to show COIVID, I wonder where it originally came from?	2020-09-05 15:42:58.093+00	2020-09-05 15:42:58.103+00	615	2691
854	excellent point and well said 	2020-09-05 15:56:22.752+00	2020-09-05 15:56:22.767+00	606	2649
855	Many things are creating uncertainty and volatility in the market and the presidential is just an additional factor. Markets will tumble if Trump isn't reelected 	2020-09-05 15:59:57.096+00	2020-09-05 15:59:57.111+00	545	2649
857	GMOs can have some major long term issues - leaky gut, increased inflammation, increased food allergies.  Not to mention a long term loss of genetic diversity in our food crops which could lead to crop failures and famine.	2020-09-05 16:15:03.831+00	2020-09-05 16:15:03.84+00	613	2667
858	Yes yes yes! we need to think globally. We're all in this together at the end of the day!	2020-09-05 16:19:42.218+00	2020-09-05 16:19:42.227+00	746	2575
859	While I think that GMO's probably are bad, I don't think there is any turning back and I don't think they are as bad as some people say they are.	2020-09-05 16:21:06.073+00	2020-09-05 16:21:07.014+00	482	2665
860	Ha ha very funny.  Will you still be laughing when loss of genetic diversity caused by GMOs results in widespread crop failure?	2020-09-05 16:26:30.605+00	2020-09-05 16:26:30.62+00	645	2667
861	Jamal_3487 I am shocked at your response about racism. I would love to hear more about it from you.	2020-09-05 16:28:01.191+00	2020-09-05 16:28:02.186+00	133	2665
862	Ha ha.  But seriously, do a little more research into the long term impacts of GMOs.  Loss of genetic diversity in our crop plants, leaky gut issues, toxins with a molecular structure similar to Ricin now introduced into our food...	2020-09-05 16:29:29.392+00	2020-09-05 16:29:29.404+00	642	2667
863	Totally agree with Claire_8713. There are many reasons why I want Trump out of the White House, but protection of the environment is a main one!	2020-09-05 16:35:54.521+00	2020-09-05 16:35:56.451+00	441	2665
864	Except dog breeds are derived from selectively breeding dogs, not from introducing DNA from completely different species or even bacterial DNA into dogs.	2020-09-05 16:36:01.397+00	2020-09-05 16:36:03.519+00	628	2667
893	What about the economy? Those suffering financially may not be too keen on concentrating on environmental concerns. Rebuild the economy will lead to greater interest and renewed environment sustainability. 	2020-09-05 18:14:35.531+00	2020-09-05 18:14:35.543+00	537	2593
865	True, but while a person focuses solely on their own home people around him/her maybe making improvements or changes that may have a negative impact on this person's home in the future, best to stay engaged and aware. 	2020-09-05 16:56:14.296+00	2020-09-05 16:56:14.305+00	606	2701
882	Stopping trolling! Trump fans. 	2020-09-05 17:20:51.563+00	2020-09-05 17:20:51.57+00	452	2601
866	Excellent point, Luke! Agree with you 100%.	2020-09-05 16:56:52.474+00	2020-09-05 16:56:52.49+00	537	2593
867	Leaders can't be trusted, focused more on the economy than the well being of of the people. 	2020-09-05 16:58:12.649+00	2020-09-05 16:58:12.659+00	625	2701
868	America, with its economic leverage, can help stabilize the world stage.  I hope we see more collaboration with this administration on the world stage. 	2020-09-05 17:00:08.669+00	2020-09-05 17:00:08.679+00	629	2593
883	Just trust scientists, is it too hard to do it?	2020-09-05 17:21:28.092+00	2020-09-05 17:21:28.099+00	613	2601
869	Wonder if technological advances are partially responsible for humans abuse of the environment. Does anyone know?	2020-09-05 17:01:30.148+00	2020-09-05 17:01:30.168+00	627	2701
870	Ensuring the health and well being of people will result in stable/consistent economic growth.  The economy won't remain consistent nor grow with healthy, happy people. 	2020-09-05 17:06:56.688+00	2020-09-05 17:06:56.698+00	554	2701
899	Disagree. So many other countries make it work, we can too. This country makes me want to relocate to Finland, where the government actually cares about their people.	2020-09-05 18:37:00.259+00	2020-09-05 18:37:00.269+00	581	2588
871	The current leader of this country only appears to believe what he wants to believe, believe's COVID 19 will just disappear, it's dangerous and getting people killed. 	2020-09-05 17:10:45.425+00	2020-09-05 17:10:45.44+00	719	2701
884	I have to agree with you. 	2020-09-05 17:28:35.008+00	2020-09-05 17:28:35.017+00	581	2601
872	We must come up with ways to protect the environment. Totally agree with you.	2020-09-05 17:12:34.554+00	2020-09-05 17:12:34.563+00	537	2601
873	Agreed, yet don't totally forget environment.	2020-09-05 17:13:30.281+00	2020-09-05 17:13:30.289+00	554	2601
894	Hahaha. Great comment! So funny.	2020-09-05 18:28:16.151+00	2020-09-05 18:28:16.161+00	642	2588
874	LOL, that's funny. 	2020-09-05 17:14:37.146+00	2020-09-05 17:14:37.156+00	492	2601
885	Yup, rich people want a better environment, while the poor just want to get fed. 	2020-09-05 17:29:42.017+00	2020-09-05 17:29:42.025+00	606	2601

877	I really don't think so. 	2020-09-05 17:16:46.722+00	2020-09-05 17:16:46.731+00	601	2601
886	Plastic is a joke! It's destroying our planet and our health. Something needs to be done. Add it to the list.	2020-09-05 17:32:49.991+00	2020-09-05 17:32:50.006+00	755	2665
878	Nice. Totally agreed. 	2020-09-05 17:17:33.577+00	2020-09-05 17:17:33.585+00	640	2601

880	That's really hard to reconcile and I am highly doubt it gonna happen.	2020-09-05 17:19:27.635+00	2020-09-05 17:19:27.644+00	569	2601

888	Why can't people have the choice between private/public health insurance?  What's changed within the last decade or so?	2020-09-05 17:44:42.738+00	2020-09-05 17:44:42.748+00	581	2701

896	I know that our government is not doing a good job in the face of COVID_19, but we as citizens are not doing it either.	2020-09-05 18:33:48.347+00	2020-09-05 18:33:48.357+00	717	2620

892	I have to say you are making some excellent points and I am starting to reevaluate my position on GMO's	2020-09-05 18:01:42.388+00	2020-09-05 18:01:43.334+00	772	2649
900	I agree. It really is sad. If we have destroy our habitat, then our economy won't matter anyways.	2020-09-05 18:38:51.204+00	2020-09-05 18:38:51.214+00	537	2588
897	I don't know. I've seem so many incorrect statistics surrounding covid-19. This is sad, if true, but I doubt the full truth is showcased in this article.	2020-09-05 18:34:00.784+00	2020-09-05 18:34:00.793+00	488	2588
903	Yes! I totally agree. We need to take care of our own first, it is just the natural order of things and we cant help other's if we aren't well.	2020-09-05 18:47:23.048+00	2020-09-05 18:47:23.058+00	606	2588
898	Agree! If we don't take care of our habitat, nothing else will matter because we won't survive.	2020-09-05 18:35:14.718+00	2020-09-05 18:35:14.734+00	441	2588
901	According to Simon Kuznets, Nobel laureate in economics in 1971, economic growth is not a threat to the environment in the long term, but a requirement to improve its quality.	2020-09-05 18:39:11.106+00	2020-09-05 18:39:11.115+00	626	2620

904	Dustin, could you provide published scientific evidence for the claims? I would love to see this data.  	2020-09-05 19:18:29.684+00	2020-09-05 19:18:29.7+00	613	2593
906	Agree, nuclear energy is not worth the risk.	2020-09-05 19:46:06.727+00	2020-09-05 19:46:06.737+00	701	2610
905	Are you saying we need to ignore world affairs? That's part of the reason why America is in this mess. We didn't listen to the rest of the world.	2020-09-05 19:30:20.127+00	2020-09-05 19:30:20.137+00	777	2610
907	I would argue that security will be even tighter leading up to the November election and limitations of movement during the current pandemic. 	2020-09-05 19:57:55.978+00	2020-09-05 19:57:55.989+00	489	2593
908	I would certainly believe that this is possible. I think that would be the case with any frontline profession - not just law enforcement. It is staggering to think that the number could exceed the 9/11 law enforcement deaths.	2020-09-05 20:03:12.26+00	2020-09-05 20:03:12.269+00	488	2655
909	That's the state government. Florida has always been shady and sinister in their dealings with state and country. The state's citizens need to vote them out. But I think the Federal Government has gone way overboard on the COVID restrictions. 	2020-09-05 20:08:19.341+00	2020-09-05 20:08:19.352+00	625	2655
910	Fantastic. Great way to see the glass has full. I will remember that!	2020-09-05 20:11:05.972+00	2020-09-05 20:11:05.982+00	640	2655
911	Less and lesser....until we fix our country. Because frankly, the world stage isn't really looking to us all that much anymore. 	2020-09-05 20:12:49.64+00	2020-09-05 20:12:49.649+00	629	2655
912	Well said!	2020-09-05 20:13:44.202+00	2020-09-05 20:13:44.209+00	606	2655

919	Yes there should be a way where we can all meet in the middle and allow people the freedom to buy in if they so chooses without people such as yourself losing your insurance.	2020-09-05 21:36:09.026+00	2020-09-05 21:36:09.033+00	569	2575
934	We can do both! Just don't panic. The DOW has already regained a lot of its momentum and will continue to. Have faith in the DOW and start being kinder to Mother Earth.	2020-09-05 22:16:36.478+00	2020-09-05 22:16:36.487+00	554	2655
920	Why cant we fix our own domestic issues while helping other nations globally? We as a nation have enough resources to do both, in my opinion!	2020-09-05 21:38:13.21+00	2020-09-05 21:38:13.219+00	606	2575
921	Would Biden do a better job? It's easier said than done in my opinion. But yes I agree, we need to do more. 	2020-09-05 21:39:43.523+00	2020-09-05 21:39:43.534+00	719	2575
922	"I can''t help but feel institutions like these are in it more for themselves than the interest of the public and communities they are '"supposed'" to be serving. Smh..."	2020-09-05 21:42:00.84+00	2020-09-05 21:42:00.849+00	625	2575

923	This. I agree so much	2020-09-05 21:42:55.212+00	2020-09-05 21:42:55.22+00	537	2714
924	This is startling, what is our government doing? The system is failing us each and every day...	2020-09-05 21:42:58.268+00	2020-09-05 21:42:58.276+00	624	2575
943	there is always a worry but we do not know until it happens it can go down or even up.	2020-09-05 23:11:38.886+00	2020-09-05 23:11:38.902+00	607	2580
925	We can do both but we need to focus more on the economy first and reduce poverty for our own citizens, then we can start to look at the environment. Just my 2 cents..	2020-09-05 21:44:39.942+00	2020-09-05 21:44:39.955+00	554	2575
936	Yes, just saying it will magically go away hasn't worked. Who would have imagined it. We were supposed to all get a chocolate Easter Bunny, not Covid...at least that's what the great Orange one said. You're right on this.	2020-09-05 22:24:48.971+00	2020-09-05 22:24:48.981+00	717	2389
926	This is scary to think about..but more search needs to be done.	2020-09-05 21:46:28.766+00	2020-09-05 21:46:28.773+00	546	2575
927	We have enough resources and ability to help other nations. We all share the same Earth and it's our responsibility to look out for our global brothers and sisters.	2020-09-05 21:48:02.69+00	2020-09-05 21:48:02.698+00	629	2575
928	Jamal_4473 Thanks for backing me up! The list could go on for days.	2020-09-05 21:48:52.389+00	2020-09-05 21:48:52.397+00	643	2655
937	That's true. Trump is parroting the Russian Trolls, his talking points exactly copy those of Putin's lackeys... ready for a mess. He's trying to incite a war.	2020-09-05 22:26:23.452+00	2020-09-05 22:26:23.472+00	489	2389
929	I'm with you man, we need to prioritize the economy. Though I wouldn't say to neglect the environment at all, it's just on a lower scale of priority for me.	2020-09-05 21:49:13.199+00	2020-09-05 21:49:13.207+00	452	2575

950	so how do you suggest reconciling protecting the environment with economic interests?  Because that's important as well.	2020-09-05 23:18:34.318+00	2020-09-05 23:18:34.326+00	537	2604

1054	As much as I want COVID to go away, I can't stand wearing these masks. It's just so hard to breathe as the airflow is restricted significantly when I have these things on my face.	2020-09-06 03:04:10.037+00	2020-09-06 03:04:10.048+00	783	2702

1063	I also disagree with the statement that allies have been wanting the return of U.S. leadership. Unfortunately, I believe that countries like Canada and Germany have been purposefully distancing themselves from the U.S.	2020-09-06 03:10:00.506+00	2020-09-06 03:10:00.519+00	655	2638

1066	Agree with Claire. Modern reactor building designs are able to withstand great force. Plus, nuclear reactors are encased in multiple layers of concrete and supporting materials. 	2020-09-06 03:13:03.302+00	2020-09-06 03:13:03.31+00	701	2593

1117	Biden all the way. He will restore faith in humanity, bring the country back together, do more towards the fight against covid. Other countries will trust us more because Biden is honest and knows how to speak to others respectfully. 	2020-09-06 12:44:46.307+00	2020-09-06 12:44:46.326+00	843	2750
1118	I agree with Diamond, probably won't be available to everyone, especially people without insurance. I anticipate long lines.	2020-09-06 12:49:22.118+00	2020-09-06 12:49:22.133+00	707	2750
1119	I think the opposite at this point. We need to focus on our homeland right now and pull ourselves together before we can help other countries. That's not to say shut them out completely but we have a lot of work to do here first.	2020-09-06 12:54:22.306+00	2020-09-06 12:54:22.32+00	557	2750
1120	Hopefully we will have a new President soon and he will change that. He won't let his ego get in the way of doing what is right here and abroad.	2020-09-06 12:57:12.975+00	2020-09-06 12:57:12.984+00	746	2750

1132	I don't know. I think it will recover. In my area, jobs are making a comeback. If this continues, recovery is imminent.	2020-09-06 13:36:16.044+00	2020-09-06 13:36:17.008+00	776	2588
1122	Nuclear power plants are dangerous. I agree we need to place our efforts into safer, environmentally friendly ways to provide energy.	2020-09-06 13:00:33.466+00	2020-09-06 13:00:33.486+00	810	2750
1123	OMG, you do make sense. I hadn't thought of it until you mentioned it. Maybe nuclear is a horrible idea. Thanks for bringing up this point...one other idea?  What if a wildfire sweeps through the area?  What about Tidal waves?  Remember Japan?	2020-09-06 13:02:50.264+00	2020-09-06 13:02:50.274+00	701	2390
1142	I mean seriously, 6 million cases and nearly 200 k deaths, that's insane.	2020-09-06 14:57:33.644+00	2020-09-06 14:57:33.651+00	719	2601

1133	Shocking but true dat.	2020-09-06 13:37:05.597+00	2020-09-06 13:37:05.606+00	102	2387
1125	Wow, that's general. What, specifically are you swayed by? What makes you feel more entrenched?	2020-09-06 13:14:10.203+00	2020-09-06 13:14:10.213+00	814	2389
1126	Our Government should be blamed for the deaths from coronavirus. The response was slow and they acted unprepared. 	2020-09-06 13:19:25.071+00	2020-09-06 13:19:25.079+00	725	2688
1127	Not really. Our weakened government (ALA Trump) is ripening for attack. Let's wake up before it's too late. Complacency won't help anyone.	2020-09-06 13:22:03.673+00	2020-09-06 13:22:03.682+00	885	2387
1134	Amy, you're right on the money here. Thanks for the link.	2020-09-06 13:39:35.638+00	2020-09-06 13:39:35.645+00	711	2388
1128	I love this info graphics. The idea of issuing a fine should be considered. Not everyone is ready to wear the mask or wear it properly. This will ensure we all abide by the rules and protect our family from the virus.	2020-09-06 13:22:54.972+00	2020-09-06 13:22:54.979+00	783	2688
1129	As he should, in my opinion. I don't care for either candidate, but this is one positive for Biden.	2020-09-06 13:28:28.331+00	2020-09-06 13:28:28.341+00	851	2588
1148	Can't believe we are dragging the world right now. 	2020-09-06 15:05:27.626+00	2020-09-06 15:05:27.634+00	655	2601
1130	I hadn't really thought much about this issue. Your post makes sense though. I'm going to keep reading about it. Do you have any more interesting posts Jack?	2020-09-06 13:33:53.998+00	2020-09-06 13:33:54.006+00	862	2387
1135	I think you might be onto something. Did you find any additional proof I can check out though?  This sort of makes sense.	2020-09-06 13:40:50.403+00	2020-09-06 13:40:50.411+00	770	2388
1131	The damage he does will be permanent. We MUST be able to trust that the vaccine is safe. Pushing for a Late October cure might just kill us all. I say let him inject himself with bleach if he must. I'm waiting for real science though.	2020-09-06 13:36:09.39+00	2020-09-06 13:36:09.398+00	859	2387
1143	That's totally ridiculous, we lost 180 thousand lives, and now we lost our dignity. Trump is the worst POTUS for sure.  	2020-09-06 14:59:43.249+00	2020-09-06 14:59:43.257+00	746	2601
1136	This is a good point. We need to be able to enjoy nature in the future. Lets support the environment and help clean it.	2020-09-06 13:42:21.201+00	2020-09-06 13:42:21.208+00	660	2388
1137	I don't love the mask either but I DO love being alive. Yes, let's keep wearing the mask.	2020-09-06 13:44:12.303+00	2020-09-06 13:44:12.313+00	120	2388
1138	That's true. We should tax ultra wealthy Claire.	2020-09-06 13:50:11.926+00	2020-09-06 13:50:11.936+00	259	2391
1144	Beautiful graphic. Once we take care of us, then perhaps we can help other nations. lets take care of flint, Michigan and other suffering areas in the U.S first.	2020-09-06 15:01:49.338+00	2020-09-06 15:01:49.347+00	780	2588
1139	One point, when Trump tanked the economy SO bad by a horrible reaction to Covid, any small increase seems great. IT ISN'T we need to start healing now.	2020-09-06 13:56:16.813+00	2020-09-06 13:56:16.823+00	108	2391
1140	We really need some concrete scientific evidence as we look into this matter further. Facts not speculation. Does anyone know a good study or series of studies related to this topic?	2020-09-06 14:56:20.362+00	2020-09-06 14:56:20.372+00	697	2593
1155	I am not saying medicare is a scam, but it cannot coexist with the current system. 	2020-09-06 15:09:05.036+00	2020-09-06 15:09:05.044+00	708	2601
1141	Trump makes US look like a joke in front of the world.	2020-09-06 14:56:55.122+00	2020-09-06 14:56:55.13+00	719	2601
1145	I have zero confidence in the Trump administration. Thanks to Trump, I don't trust CDC now. 	2020-09-06 15:02:16.769+00	2020-09-06 15:02:17.657+00	717	2601
1149	I am optimistic. With unemployment going down, it's equally likely that it could go up.	2020-09-06 15:05:31.763+00	2020-09-06 15:05:31.773+00	607	2588
1146	We might have the second wave in the winter, hope we would have effective vaccine by that time. 	2020-09-06 15:03:32.133+00	2020-09-06 15:03:32.141+00	776	2601
1147	Imagine we issued mask mandate back in March or April, we might have less than 40 % cases now. 	2020-09-06 15:04:50.351+00	2020-09-06 15:04:50.36+00	783	2601
1153	I don't agree, nuclear power plants are proven to be safe. 	2020-09-06 15:08:15.889+00	2020-09-06 15:08:15.899+00	701	2601
1150	Thanks for sharing, our govt sucks. Everyone just don't forget to vote. 	2020-09-06 15:06:29.098+00	2020-09-06 15:06:29.109+00	725	2601
1151	I agree. Jobs are coming back and will change the numbers. Another stimulus check would help promote spending, too.	2020-09-06 15:07:25.045+00	2020-09-06 15:07:25.054+00	816	2588
1152	Can't agree more! We shall be the lighthouse of democracy and humanity. 	2020-09-06 15:07:29.572+00	2020-09-06 15:07:29.579+00	780	2601
1154	Sure hope so! I'm optimistic. I know Trump wants one out before election. It would be great for our economy, especially if received in the fall before the holidays.	2020-09-06 15:09:03.111+00	2020-09-06 15:09:03.119+00	844	2588
1156	I don't trust a new vaccine rolled out so quickly. I don't think everyone will want it. I do think it could have a positive effect on the economy.  	2020-09-06 15:11:18.704+00	2020-09-06 15:11:18.714+00	707	2588
1157	When will America stand up and be a global leader once again? I’m not asking for world dominance, but rather engagement in global affairs and policy. Will a new leader change anything? 	2020-09-06 15:11:55.331+00	2020-09-06 15:11:56.519+00	655	2593
1158	I disagree, I think in some ways the government is doing too much. That said, I am in New York where there has been a strong and strict response.	2020-09-06 15:12:48.814+00	2020-09-06 15:12:48.828+00	646	2588
1159	I agree. I've said it before, without a safe habitat, nothing else will matter.	2020-09-06 15:14:27.685+00	2020-09-06 15:14:27.7+00	904	2588
1160	That is going too far. As an asthma sufferer, a mask is extremely difficult for me to breathe through. Not everyone is medically able to wear a mask for extended periods of time. Even going to the grocery store can be disastrous for me.. 	2020-09-06 15:18:55.318+00	2020-09-06 15:18:56.745+00	783	2588
1201	you can fine people all you want but I do not think it will deter people much because our leadership has been too busy with elections over the virus	2020-09-06 18:00:40.711+00	2020-09-06 18:00:40.727+00	783	2580
1161	Ending wars is one thing, but being a global team player in other affairs is vital not only for the world, but for America as well. Our economies and communities are intertwined. 	2020-09-06 15:20:25.735+00	2020-09-06 15:20:25.744+00	739	2593
1162	I agree. I believe in medicare for all, not for some! If other countries, like Finland, can do it then so can we.	2020-09-06 15:20:27.33+00	2020-09-06 15:20:27.337+00	896	2588
1163	I think the government has done too much, but Yikes! These kids are not protecting themselves at all. They should at least be standing six feet apart. 	2020-09-06 15:22:47.168+00	2020-09-06 15:22:47.186+00	714	2588
1175	A less biased news source would have been nice, but I agree that economic growth is needed. 	2020-09-06 16:09:04.941+00	2020-09-06 16:09:04.955+00	779	2593
1164	I think this article is biased. In Finland and other similar countries, they make it work and their people are healthier and happier.	2020-09-06 15:24:37.723+00	2020-09-06 15:24:37.733+00	708	2588
1165	Completely agree! If there is one thing that Covid-19 has shown us, it's that the poor are extremely essential workers and deserve a living wage, at the very least.	2020-09-06 15:26:46.454+00	2020-09-06 15:26:46.469+00	823	2588

1182	I agree. We need to have a fair tax. If you make X, you pay Y%. That rule should be strict and across the board. We don't need all these complex rules.	2020-09-06 16:53:55.025+00	2020-09-06 16:53:55.033+00	713	2711
1169	exactly...why have other countries been able to stay open and still keep their numbers down? Yes, we need a vaccine but people, not the government need to be responsible.	2020-09-06 15:33:40.027+00	2020-09-06 15:33:40.035+00	142	2649
1177	@Luke Walton, I think we will be more effective if we work on fixing our domestic issues first.  At this point, our domestic issues are hindering our ability to be engaged effectively internationally.  	2020-09-06 16:40:13.813+00	2020-09-06 16:40:13.83+00	606	2543

1172	A 3-4% return is better than the 0.06% you get from major banks. Stay in the market race, keep calm, as things will improve. Long term investors will  benefit from the recession we are in. 	2020-09-06 15:46:35.14+00	2020-09-06 15:46:35.156+00	776	2593

1179	I think America should make all the  countries leading scientists work together to make a vaccine with the help of WHO. Im sure with all these minds, we can get one created quickly.	2020-09-06 16:49:51.279+00	2020-09-06 16:49:51.295+00	746	2711

1180	It's not either/or but which is more important to us.  Obviously domestic should be more important, and in times like these when we are facing multiple crises, we need to focus first and foremost on the challenges we are facing at home. 	2020-09-06 16:52:28.598+00	2020-09-06 16:52:28.605+00	720	2543

1194	The graphic is great, but we don't need fines.  I think the government has failed in fighting covid, but it hasn't failed because it didn't fine people.  Sheesh.	2020-09-06 17:39:49.225+00	2020-09-06 17:39:49.24+00	783	2541

1191	I agree. I made a post the other day about how people are wearing masks incorrectly. We need to mandate a mask policy where if you wear one incorrectly, you'll get a fine.	2020-09-06 17:33:40.105+00	2020-09-06 17:33:40.614+00	717	2711

1196	Economic growth is needed.  But I don't know what planet this guy lives on painting such a rosy picture.  I think Trump economy was doing great til coronavirus hit but we haven't seen the worst yet.	2020-09-06 17:44:58.953+00	2020-09-06 17:44:58.968+00	779	2541
1197	Is there an English version of this diagram? The photos are informative but I would like to read the descriptions to get a better understanding of the content. 	2020-09-06 17:45:09.569+00	2020-09-06 17:45:09.576+00	649	2701
1198	Wise strategy. Some people for more sorry for other countries than the people suffering right next to them.  Wrong.	2020-09-06 17:46:47.106+00	2020-09-06 17:46:47.121+00	753	2541
1199	@Brad Lewis, I'm in Georgia where it's been the exact opposite of New York, because our governor won't stand up to Trump.	2020-09-06 17:52:22.463+00	2020-09-06 17:52:22.471+00	646	2750
1200	Agree! We have lost our respect in the world. 	2020-09-06 17:52:44.899+00	2020-09-06 17:52:44.906+00	721	2593
1202	that is good I think the economy will continue to grow and will not go into a depression like people believe.	2020-09-06 18:02:49.168+00	2020-09-06 18:02:49.178+00	779	2580
1219	Agreed, good article.	2020-09-06 19:39:21.365+00	2020-09-06 19:39:22.441+00	276	2390
1208	We all need to make sure we vote and continue to stay engaged after elections, too.  Follow up those politicians to make sure they really lead and really represent.	2020-09-06 18:34:19.449+00	2020-09-06 18:34:19.465+00	725	2540
1209	Social gatherings should not be allowed, they are super spreaders. 	2020-09-06 18:34:34.714+00	2020-09-06 18:34:35.553+00	714	2701
1226	If you are going to raise taxes, then you should explain why you are doing so. He is not providing specific examples for what he wants to do with the money which is a problem.	2020-09-06 20:39:22.272+00	2020-09-06 20:39:22.278+00	851	2638
1210	We need a federal mask mandate cause during the George Floyd protest I saw a large amount of law enforcement not wearing mask. Am aware that mask wearing is not 100% effective but they can provide protection. Too many senseless deaths in the U.S..	2020-09-06 18:39:22.278+00	2020-09-06 18:39:22.286+00	658	2701
1220	I agree with Willie.  And most economists would as well.  Many are predicting that we really won't have a sustainable recovery til there is a viable vaccine, and likely that's not gonna happen in the next couple months.	2020-09-06 19:44:48.919+00	2020-09-06 19:44:48.934+00	776	2667
1211	So true, it is going to take a collaborative effort to create a safe and effective vaccine. The spread of the virus in the U.S. is out of control, we need all the help we can get. 	2020-09-06 18:48:42.755+00	2020-09-06 18:48:48.02+00	746	2701
1212	I think our country just has so much on it's plate right now, we need to focus on saving as many people from coronavirus as we can and fixing our economy before we are in any kind of position to help other countries.	2020-09-06 19:04:11.676+00	2020-09-06 19:04:11.692+00	777	2667
1213	This is tragic.  And with so many losses, this is why we really need to turn our focus as a country inward to save as many American lives from this pandemic as we can.	2020-09-06 19:05:44.72+00	2020-09-06 19:05:44.727+00	717	2667
1221	As a country, we definitely need to focus more resources on mask enforcement and getting the word out to wear masks properly.   We also need to focus more resources internally towards social distancing enforcement to help save lives.	2020-09-06 19:54:09.339+00	2020-09-06 19:54:09.348+00	783	2667
1214	This is really sad.  Our country really needs to dedicate resources on a large scale towards saving as many American lives as we can from this awful pandemic, and most especially our first responders who give so much to help others.	2020-09-06 19:08:59.36+00	2020-09-06 19:08:59.375+00	658	2667

1216	First we have to get people to understand the importance of wearing a mask, seriousness of this illness is being downplayed by our leaders. 	2020-09-06 19:26:10.885+00	2020-09-06 19:26:10.893+00	783	2701
1222	I agree. The rich, like Trump, end up getting subsidies, avoiding taxes, and then declare bankruptcies. Meanwhile, we toil, make our dollar and give the gov. their 30%, while the rich call us suckers.  Pay the piper, I say.	2020-09-06 19:57:35.607+00	2020-09-06 19:57:35.617+00	778	2389
1217	Not only the government is to blame for what happens in our country, we must all cooperate to get out of this pandemic. This image says more than a thousand words. Let's become aware.	2020-09-06 19:37:49.545+00	2020-09-06 19:37:49.553+00	714	2620
1227	From my personal situation, I do not know many people who are still unemployed due to the pandemic. What I do see is people around me investing and even encouraging me to invest as well.	2020-09-06 20:41:18.635+00	2020-09-06 20:41:18.643+00	776	2638

1232	the government will always fail you if you wait for them. Your state should be the one that matters,don't expect help from Washington focus on your community	2020-09-06 20:50:37.395+00	2020-09-06 20:50:37.406+00	717	2580
1223	Maybe if we invested more in wind and solar, we could bring the costs down, and also, you know, save the environment and planet.	2020-09-06 20:02:19.616+00	2020-09-06 20:02:19.631+00	917	2610
1228	I would say that it is actually a great time to take advantage of conditions and invest now, knowing that you can make a profit.	2020-09-06 20:42:24.338+00	2020-09-06 20:42:24.353+00	776	2638

1225	America needs to embrace international organizations like the WHO, not push them to the side. We are sacrificing our well being by choosing to not participate.	2020-09-06 20:38:02.445+00	2020-09-06 20:38:02.453+00	746	2638
1229	@Jenna_214 I agree, you aren't going to make any money by keeping your money in your bank account. The interest earned can maybe only keep up with inflation and that's it.	2020-09-06 20:43:31.696+00	2020-09-06 20:43:31.705+00	776	2638
1233	You just said in another post that Trump is preventing a new efficient wealth tax. You are contradicting yourself.	2020-09-06 20:50:53.685+00	2020-09-06 20:50:53.691+00	890	2638
1230	Yes, and we need to do this by investing in our own economy and supporting markets here.	2020-09-06 20:45:06.344+00	2020-09-06 20:45:08.21+00	777	2638
1231	What would make a wealth tax be efficient? I would argue the opposite.	2020-09-06 20:49:57.941+00	2020-09-06 20:49:58.009+00	891	2638
1236	Even though I am more optimistic than you, I appreciate how thorough and considerate your analysis is.	2020-09-06 21:00:14.448+00	2020-09-06 21:00:14.462+00	767	2638

1235	@Heather_6355 We can influence other countries without using war as a method. Diplomacy works too.	2020-09-06 20:54:10.993+00	2020-09-06 20:54:11.001+00	206	2638

1239	I think it's probably of use to coders. I, like you, see little that's of value - but someone probably does..If they do, they'll likely not tell you though.	2020-09-06 21:35:31.657+00	2020-09-06 21:35:31.666+00	574	2388
1238	Kind of hard to feel too sorry for someone making 50 million in one day. They can afford to kick in a tiny bit. Scrooge would love you. He also knew how to hang onto his money, sharing nothing.	2020-09-06 21:28:58.82+00	2020-09-06 21:28:58.828+00	852	2388

1242	There are a lot of decent people of privilege that abide by tax laws (instead of manipulating loopholes to avoid paying), who, themselves, believe they should be paying more in taxes. I choose to agree with them. (Thank you, Warren Buffet). 	2020-09-06 21:53:42.021+00	2020-09-06 21:53:42.029+00	713	2655

1245	This is distressing to see but not surprising given this administration. What's going to happen when another country not friendly to the US develops a vaccine first and then give it to every other country before us?	2020-09-06 22:19:47.407+00	2020-09-06 22:19:47.422+00	746	2618

1273	We have no choice with interest rates so low. Savers are loosing the battle. Looks like being in the market is the only viable option. Economic growth and the Fed will keep markets alive. 	2020-09-07 00:49:45.635+00	2020-09-07 00:49:45.669+00	779	2593

1249	At some point, the parents should take some responsibility for their kids. The government is butting in too much to our personal liberties. These kids lack common sense (and apparently parents who read or watch the news). 	2020-09-06 22:59:37.001+00	2020-09-06 22:59:37.015+00	714	2655

1252	I do think there should be Medicare available to all. But the question is: can socialized medicine work in a capitalist nation? I think we've got our work cut for ourselves.	2020-09-06 23:08:12.775+00	2020-09-06 23:08:12.792+00	708	2655

1299	I think Democrats will ignore good news about the pandemic and maybe even go back into lockdown. And they will run up deficits and not be pro-business. And Republicans will do the opposite and ignore bad news. And they won't help people who need it.	2020-09-07 02:13:26.419+00	2020-09-07 02:13:26.427+00	843	2457

1336	The amount of confusion surrounding the disease didn't help in the early days. The government needs to do a better job of keeping the public informed so that we can take the right actions and turn things around.	2020-09-07 03:16:15.041+00	2020-09-07 03:16:16.94+00	964	2702

1344	Just because it doesn't kill you right away doesn't mean it isn't harming you for a slow death. Think cigarettes. It takes years before you see the effects but make no mistake, it will catch up with you eventually.	2020-09-07 03:49:18.305+00	2020-09-07 03:49:18.315+00	744	2702

1359	@Jen Nah, I completely agree.  You know what they say about you can judge the character of a society by how they treat the weakest among them?

1417	First off, Trump never told that 17 year old to do anything. He was just protecting his neighborhood. He's a hero. Secondly, there is no real terror going on here at all. Just give it a rest. Stop over reacting.	2020-09-07 14:10:30.628+00	2020-09-07 14:10:30.635+00	412	2391

1420	There's not much more they can do, without taking away our freedom and rights. They've done too much already, in my opinion. People need to protect themselves as best they can and hopefully we can get this over with quickly.	2020-09-07 14:16:51.039+00	2020-09-07 14:16:51.048+00	964	2588

1434	Yes, we have to do something. I've heard this is the worst US fire season in history. It's time to act. There are many bible verses that support this.	2020-09-07 14:53:18.429+00	2020-09-07 14:53:18.445+00	1036	2391

The next odd thing, the cops didn''t even arrest them when he approached them to confess, they just gave him a bottle of water."	2020-09-07 19:44:33.422+00	2020-09-07 19:44:35.94+00	412	2387
1541	Leaders are placing more importance on the economy instead of controlling the virus. This is not okay. 	2020-09-07 19:45:45.186+00	2020-09-07 19:45:48.087+00	964	2701
1542	we havent even hit 200k I think saying it will be 400k is dangerous to put people in fear	2020-09-07 19:48:36.368+00	2020-09-07 19:48:36.375+00	964	2580
1543	You're welcome! :)  Thanks so much for your kind comment!	2020-09-07 19:48:43.334+00	2020-09-07 19:48:43.357+00	1009	2667
1544	Yeah the more I read, the more concerned I get.  I used to dismiss this stuff, not so much anymore.	2020-09-07 19:50:10.651+00	2020-09-07 19:50:10.669+00	1001	2667
1545	This is chilling. I may never get back to sleep now.	2020-09-07 19:51:34.895+00	2020-09-07 19:51:37.792+00	747	2387
1546	Scary.  Doesn't bode well for our economy either, til we get this under control.	2020-09-07 19:53:15.185+00	2020-09-07 19:53:15.198+00	964	2667
1548	I wonder how much is going to aid overseas?  Maybe we need to use our resources to help struggling Americans here.	2020-09-07 19:54:47.601+00	2020-09-07 19:54:50.049+00	1045	2667
1573	Right now, I'm looking out my window. the California fire smoke is making it hard to see out. Ash is falling. I think we have to act now.	2020-09-07 20:44:35.183+00	2020-09-07 20:44:37.979+00	1036	2387
1549	Excellent post.  We definitely have so many problems here in the USA that we need to fix.  With widespread racial inequality and a raging pandemic our country is in crisis.	2020-09-07 19:57:22.294+00	2020-09-07 19:57:23.432+00	1032	2667
1560	Unless you start working on battery development and energy storage, all other environmental energy is unreliable. Coal and nuclear are the best alternative and reliable sources, especially during the winter, and we know how bad coal is.	2020-09-07 20:23:59.235+00	2020-09-07 20:23:59.242+00	920	2711
1550	Have to agree with Biden. Issues such as climate change cannot be handled solo, we have to collaborate with others to bring about change on a global level. 	2020-09-07 19:57:35.46+00	2020-09-07 19:57:35.467+00	996	2701
1551	GMOs have only been around since the 1990s, so we can't have centuries of data.  There are many long term issues and more rigorous testing is needed.	2020-09-07 19:59:04.357+00	2020-09-07 19:59:04.372+00	923	2667
1568	Without a stable economy, our citizens will not have the strength and desire to engage in environmental protection in any meaningful way. 	2020-09-07 20:38:25.471+00	2020-09-07 20:38:25.477+00	904	2593
1552	A DHS report was leaked a few days ago which states that far-right extremist groups are the number one largest terrorist threat to the US and will remain so at least until 2021	2020-09-07 20:03:00.857+00	2020-09-07 20:03:11.726+00	933	2709
1561	trump can not be the one who made it like this,what is happening has been brewing for decades	2020-09-07 20:26:16.162+00	2020-09-07 20:26:16.172+00	1010	2580
1553	Agree completely  We are in crisis.  We need to focus our resources here and buckle down and fix this before it's too late.	2020-09-07 20:08:57.387+00	2020-09-07 20:08:57.4+00	934	2667
1554	But at what cost?  Increase of leaky gut, loss of important genetic diversity in our crops, long term loss of biodiversity.	2020-09-07 20:12:49.106+00	2020-09-07 20:12:49.115+00	999	2667
1555	Wow that's sure something to think about.  We really need to do a better job at fighting this pandemic, and focus our resources here at home to get through this and keep people safer.	2020-09-07 20:14:16.321+00	2020-09-07 20:14:16.328+00	1034	2667
1562	I'm looking into this some more. This seems to make sense though. Can you give me a link or more detail though?  I've been reading up on this and some of the reports seem to run counter to this.	2020-09-07 20:28:49.234+00	2020-09-07 20:28:49.256+00	1078	2387
1556	I can give you ICE. Citizens in Alaska are gaining property value because of their land not being pressed against Glaciers. Their land is rising and thus the property markers are moving outwards.	2020-09-07 20:16:44.029+00	2020-09-07 20:16:46.703+00	1036	2711
1557	While I generally like Biden, I think that for now while our country is in crisis we really need to concentrate our resources here.	2020-09-07 20:20:10.825+00	2020-09-07 20:20:10.839+00	996	2667
1558	Or just move to a socialist country instead.	2020-09-07 20:20:27.53+00	2020-09-07 20:20:27.537+00	1046	2601
1563	im not sure both parties are bad so it is hard to decide both that really do not seem to care much except for their own party when it should be all of us	2020-09-07 20:31:54.013+00	2020-09-07 20:31:54.026+00	996	2580
1559	I agree.  We need to focus our resources here and fix our environment, our economy, and get through this pandemic crisis together as a country.	2020-09-07 20:23:40.267+00	2020-09-07 20:23:40.276+00	907	2667
1569	Funny Hashtag. I like the link. You have a lot of these links, I appreciate it.	2020-09-07 20:40:31.954+00	2020-09-07 20:40:33.027+00	735	2387
1564	I think I'll do that later, I'm planning on going for a walk when it cools off a bit. Thanks for the idea.	2020-09-07 20:32:55.979+00	2020-09-07 20:32:57.691+00	877	2387

1570	Do we think a Biden win can control the pandemic? Is shutting down the country the best option?	2020-09-07 20:41:47.27+00	2020-09-07 20:41:49.705+00	964	2593

1571	I disagree with the line in the article that says that their foreign policy approaches could not be more dissimilar. If Trump choose complete isolation then I would agree, but he has demonstrated a desire to cooperate with other countries.	2020-09-07 20:43:46.021+00	2020-09-07 20:43:46.028+00	996	2638
1572	Have to agree, a safe environment will result in healthy people to build the economy. We destroy the environment we destroy ourselves. 	2020-09-07 20:44:03.124+00	2020-09-07 20:44:03.133+00	904	2701
1577	@Jenna_214 I believe that other countries have more to learn from us than we have to learn from them. However, I do think that cooperation is always a good thing.	2020-09-07 20:49:44.315+00	2020-09-07 20:49:48.82+00	1045	2638
1575	Yep, one of his biggest accomplishments....destroying our environment. 	2020-09-07 20:47:37.222+00	2020-09-07 20:47:37.23+00	1010	2655
1579	Have to agree, I wake daily hoping our leaders will take this virus seriously, have finally realized it won't happen with the current leadership in this country. 	2020-09-07 20:51:19.531+00	2020-09-07 20:51:22.188+00	934	2701
1576	Yes, we need more transparency when it comes to spending. This is why it doesn't make sense to enact another wealth tax when we will have no idea where that money will be going!	2020-09-07 20:48:27.962+00	2020-09-07 20:48:27.972+00	1045	2638
1578	We absolutely should be working together and supporting other countries...but we should not be meddling in issues where our opinion is not sought. We need to worry about the US.	2020-09-07 20:49:45.284+00	2020-09-07 20:49:49.456+00	996	2655
1580	We need to help those who are poor. It's a moral duty. Think of being kind to others. It's not ok to leave our poor dying in the ditches and streets. NO. medical care for all now. Make buying medicare possible for everyone.	2020-09-07 20:55:24.172+00	2020-09-07 20:55:24.182+00	1017	2387
1581	I agree. I think so many people are just resistant to change because they don't understand it. And, of course, because there is corporate greed at play as well. I don't know why people don't understand that this would benefit us all.	2020-09-07 21:00:36.312+00	2020-09-07 21:00:36.322+00	920	2655
1582	COVID 19 has shown us we need to be better prepared for these sort of attacks, bioterrorism. Like the previous post, not 100% sure where or how COVID 19 originated or began. 	2020-09-07 21:03:26.622+00	2020-09-07 21:03:26.63+00	945	2701
1583	One of the only benefits I see to eating GMO's, people won't go hungry. 	2020-09-07 21:05:03.664+00	2020-09-07 21:05:03.678+00	999	2701
1584	Unfortunately I think that the U.S. tends to ignore African countries in favor of more familiar European allies, which is a shame because we could learn a lot from those countries.	2020-09-07 21:06:52.385+00	2020-09-07 21:06:52.399+00	1034	2638
1585	The fact that questions like this even need to be asked prove that we need to change our approach to cooperation and politics in the Middle East.	2020-09-07 21:11:14.476+00	2020-09-07 21:11:14.489+00	933	2638
1586	Large amounts of people in the U.S. are not taking COVID 19 seriously which is leading to the out of control spread. 	2020-09-07 21:11:16.725+00	2020-09-07 21:11:16.732+00	1034	2701
1598	@Jenna_214 Good question. There are already too many restrictions and we are seeing the fallout within the economy already with having things shut down. If we don't, the impact to the economy is going to be devestating.	2020-09-07 22:24:02.808+00	2020-09-07 22:24:02.816+00	964	2718
1587	I wouldn't say that it would ruin their lives, but it would definitely lead to more resentment and distrust toward the government among the wealthy.	2020-09-07 21:14:05.529+00	2020-09-07 21:14:05.544+00	995	2638
1588	@Claire_679 Even without a new wealth tax, the wealthy are already not being treated equally. They already pay higher marginal income tax rates.	2020-09-07 21:15:20.537+00	2020-09-07 21:15:20.551+00	995	2638
1604	Yes, it is terrifying for people who work retail making just above minimum wage whether to stick it out and put themselves at serious risk or lose their healthcare due to not working. That should not even be a discussion, but it is.	2020-09-07 22:40:05.637+00	2020-09-07 22:40:05.65+00	1017	2718
1589	@Dustin_3915. Right now about 1% of government spending goes toward foreign aid. It really isn't that much but it is important in maintaining American influence abroad.	2020-09-07 21:17:43.438+00	2020-09-07 21:17:43.452+00	1045	2638
1599	For sure!  Do your research and stay safe!	2020-09-07 22:24:52.715+00	2020-09-07 22:24:52.728+00	774	2667
1590	The studies they are running are not rigorous enough.  There needs to be more rigorous testing that looks at more long term impacts of GMOs.   Look at the differences in micronutrients just for starters.	2020-09-07 21:41:06.217+00	2020-09-07 21:41:06.231+00	958	2667
1591	I agree. It's over 100 degrees where I am right now. 	2020-09-07 21:42:38.8+00	2020-09-07 21:42:38.808+00	1089	2388
1592	I think this deserves attention too. Link is great.	2020-09-07 21:56:10.207+00	2020-09-07 21:56:10.214+00	567	2388
1600	Thanks for mentioning Doctors. I think we can get even more people involved in the medical program if they don't have to watch their patients go untreated because of bad medical insurance. Medicare for all now.	2020-09-07 22:27:42.286+00	2020-09-07 22:27:43.131+00	901	2388
1593	As a country, we really need to get it together.  This is not ok.  We need to focus our efforts here in this country to enforce social distancing better, get a working vaccine, and start saving lives.	2020-09-07 22:06:25.808+00	2020-09-07 22:06:27.223+00	127	2667
1594	Wow Allison, is it coming toward you? Are you safe?  I hope so.	2020-09-07 22:07:01.202+00	2020-09-07 22:07:01.208+00	1036	2388
1595	Too many of these reports calling GMOs safe are written by scientists funded by big agribusiness.  More rigorous testing and independent research is needed.	2020-09-07 22:08:27.931+00	2020-09-07 22:08:27.939+00	991	2667
1601	Agree. Trump has been dismantling so many laws put in place to protect the environment, native habitats, and endangered species. His profit and getting support from big businesses is his main goal. As an environmentalist, this has been terrifying to see.	2020-09-07 22:28:38.248+00	2020-09-07 22:28:38.255+00	1010	2718
1596	I think he has fueled the flames of world hatred the likes of which we have never seen before. We are mocked. We are viewed as weak and as patsies. That sounds like an easy target to attack.	2020-09-07 22:10:09.146+00	2020-09-07 22:10:09.166+00	899	2655
1597	I'm not so sure about this. I think it might be an overreaction?  I wish you had more concrete proof.	2020-09-07 22:12:09.231+00	2020-09-07 22:12:09.237+00	911	2388
1605	But what about the economy? We need to put in less restrictions so that people do not starve from being unable to get work due to so many businesses closing. Plus, people's mental health depends on being able to socialize and go back to normal.	2020-09-07 22:41:26.9+00	2020-09-07 22:41:26.915+00	932	2718
1602	Yeah the country is in crisis and too many people don't want to see it.  We really need to focus our efforts on getting this under control instead of saving the world.	2020-09-07 22:33:33.687+00	2020-09-07 22:33:33.701+00	932	2667
1603	Agree with Claire Hodgkins... taxing them 2% is a drop in the ocean for them. With those funds, we could provide affordable healthcare, housing, and create job training for lower income who find it hard to get into a livable wage workforce.	2020-09-07 22:36:13.916+00	2020-09-07 22:36:13.924+00	995	2718
1608	I agree.  The situation is totally out of control.  We need to really focus on solving our own country's problems and get through this crisis together, hopefully all in one piece.	2020-09-07 22:44:49.602+00	2020-09-07 22:44:49.616+00	1030	2667
1606	Jamal, just look at the record. Trump has been rattling up mess. https://www.justsecurity.org/70419/ten-days-that-show-why-trumps-wrong-on-terrorism/ Check this out.	2020-09-07 22:42:08.449+00	2020-09-07 22:42:08.476+00	238	2388
1607	Agree, although we can also fight for multiple causes at once. Taxing the rich #2 would allow funding for additional programs, such as social workers and other non-violent interventions, that would assist with less police violence.	2020-09-07 22:43:25.367+00	2020-09-07 22:43:25.375+00	1046	2718
1616	Wait, I think I figured this graph out. I bet it's New York state or City Corona Virus deaths. This actually does NOT prove your point Carly... I KNOW the death rate wasn't less than a hundred people for any of these dates, US wide.	2020-09-07 22:56:07.111+00	2020-09-07 22:56:07.119+00	1016	2390
1609	I will agree with Biden that having the US take a stronger hand in world affairs will make the US more secure and safer.	2020-09-07 22:44:57.717+00	2020-09-07 22:44:57.723+00	996	2719
1612	Thanks for the info. I'm considering your point.	2020-09-07 22:50:01.573+00	2020-09-07 22:50:01.579+00	745	2390
1610	I wonder if you've read anything compelling to support that point though?	2020-09-07 22:49:04.776+00	2020-09-07 22:49:04.784+00	905	2390
1611	Thank you so much!  The more I read about this stuff, the more worrisome it gets.  Stay safe out there!	2020-09-07 22:49:45.197+00	2020-09-07 22:49:45.204+00	772	2667
1615	What is this graph? Is it Junior's homework? I can't make heads or tails of it and there are no descriptors on death's from what?	2020-09-07 22:54:35.779+00	2020-09-07 22:54:35.787+00	1016	2390
1613	Hope there is no fire though?  Is there?  I'm safe enough here.	2020-09-07 22:50:44.831+00	2020-09-07 22:50:44.847+00	1089	2390
1614	Really sad.  The government should be funding these tests instead of spending money saving the rest of the world.  This is a major public health crisis.	2020-09-07 22:53:19.641+00	2020-09-07 22:53:19.648+00	929	2667
