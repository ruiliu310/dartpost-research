466	In June 2019, the top 10% hold almost 70% of the total wealth of the United States. The bottom 50% hold only about 2% of the nation's wealth. With the current system, the wealthier continue to get wealthier and the mid to lower class will continue to struggle as the gap widens. Taxing households with a net worth of 50 million dollars will provide more money for services to assist lower income to help work their way up and better distribute the wealth within the mid to lower classes..

From the hypotheses of this author, the theory of the Environmental Kuznets Curve has been developed, which comes to represent how the growth of the economy affects the environment. According to this theory, the relationship between these two variables draws an '"inverted U'", so that, as growth increases, environmental degradation increases only up to a certain point, after which it begins to decrease. In other words, when a time of economic development has arrived, it no longer negatively affects the environment.

- this means that the US will spend about $1,110 billion on healthcare while the UK will spend $230 billion

- The population of the US is 328 million, which means that the US will spend, on average, $3,384 per year on each citizen.  

- The UK, by comparison has about 66.65 million people, which means they''ll spend $3,450 per year on each citizen, again on average.
