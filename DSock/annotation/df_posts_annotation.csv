The crops are protected against viruses, insects and weeds.

Thanks to herbicide and pesticide tolerant plants, these are used less, which is good for the environment and the economy, because they reduce costs.

The fruits are more resistant, durable or even more nutritious.

They are prepared to develop in sterile or drought areas where until now it was practically impossible to plant.

Larger fruits are obtained and, consequently, more profitable.

Proteins can be added to help fight disease and malnutrition.

Plants and animals grow faster.
